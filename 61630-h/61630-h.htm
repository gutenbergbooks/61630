<span class="smcap">A Father’s Love</span></h3>

<p>Mauney Bard did not enjoy mending fences.
They were quite essential in the general economy
of farming. Without them the cows would wander where
they had no business, trampling precious crops or perhaps
getting mired in these infernal boglands. In principle,
therefore, his present occupation was logical, but
in practice it was tedious.</p>

<p>During the long afternoon he occasionally paused for
diversion to gaze across the wide tract of verdant wilderness
before him. Like a lake, choked by vegetation
from beneath and strangled by determined vegetation
on all sides, the Lantern Marsh surrendered its aquatic
ambition. There was very little water to be seen.
Only a distant glare of reflected sky remained here and
there, espied between banks of thick sedges. A cruel
conspiracy of nature! Acres of rice-grass and blue flags
with their bayonet-like leaves stabbed up through the
all-but-hidden surface, while a flat pavement of rank
lilies hastened to conceal any water that dared show itself.
For two gloomy miles the defeated thing extended,
while outraged evergreens, ill-nourished and
frantic, crowded close, like friends, to shield its perennial
disgrace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>It had always been there, unexplored and forbidding,
inhabited by the mud hen, the wild duck, and the blue
crane. Mauney sometimes hated its desolate presence
and wondered why his father’s farm had to be so near
it. But the question challenged custom and actuality—things
his young brain had not learned to affront.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon he was roused from work by
a sound as of tensed, satin fans cutting the air. He
looked up to behold the broad wings of a blue crane,
passing low. The rising wind which had roused it
from its feeding grounds brought the dank odor of decayed
poplar wood and the wild aroma of rice-grass.
His eye dropped to the green waste of the marsh,
brushed into fitful waves of tidal grey, and then shifted
to the moving limbs of bare hemlocks and birches at the
border of the swamp.</p>

<p>Chilled by the sharp blast, he straightened himself to
his feet, his shirt moulded to the underlying sculptory of
his vigorous young chest. His wind-tossed, auburn hair
peeled back from his fine forehead, as his wide, blue
eyes received the rugged beauty and his lips smiled from
sheer visual delight. Then, as he gazed, a bright magic,
bursting from the west behind him, transformed his
wilderness momentarily to a static tableau of metallic
gold.</p>

<p>It was supper time. Moments since the kitchen bell
had been ringing, rocking under its cupola on the kitchen
roof. His father, his brother and the hired man, fertilizing
the grain field beyond the shoulder of the hill,
would have heard it and be promptly on their way. After
drawing on his faded coat, he picked up a pair of
pliers from the ground and shoved them into the hip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
pocket of his overalls. He shouldered his axe and
saw, then started.</p>

<p>The long marsh was separated from his father’s farm
by the Beulah road, a narrow clay highway curving
past the head of the swamp toward the village of
Beulah. In the opposite direction, it ran on eventually to
the town of Lockwood on the bank of the St. Lawrence.
The Bard farmhouse, a prosperous red brick structure,
faced the road and the swamp, presenting a stone fence
of dry masonry, and within the fence an apple-orchard.
At one side a lane, guarded by a board gate, led in
from the road.</p>

<p>As Mauney swung up the lane toward the farmyard
the crisp snap of a whip was borne to his ears from
below the shoulder of the grain-field, followed by a
man’s call to his horses:</p>

<p>“Git ap!... yah lazy devils!... git ap!”</p>

<p>A second crack of the whip—then the rumble of
heavy wheels and the rattle of the board-bottom of the
wagon. The usual, boring sights and sounds!</p>

<p>The yard echoed to the barking of a collie who was
springing in savage enjoyment at the heels of tardy
cows. The lazy animals jogged in awkward trot, as their
full udders swung to the rhythm of their gait. As
Mauney crossed the yard, wading with gluey steps
through the soft under-foot, the dog darted toward
him, splashing through brown-stained pools of stagnant
water.</p>

<p>“Go on back, Rover!” he commanded, stepping aside
to avoid his rough welcome. “Chase them up, Rover!”</p>

<p>Rover paused on his four feet only long enough to
cast up a glance of searching inquiry at his young master’s
face, when, as if satisfied that his mood were congenial,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
he immediately returned to his task with doubled
despatch.</p>

<p>In making toward the great, red barn at the farther
side of the yard, Mauney passed the henhouse, from
which radiated a pungent, ammoniacal odor, all too familiar
to his nostrils. In the drive shed, on the beams
several white hens were settling to roost. One of these
fowl, jealous of position, pecked the head of its fellow,
causing an expostulant cackle of pain. The sudden disturbance
of this sound spread to the precincts of the
quiescent henhouse, whereupon one crescendo of rasping
invective followed another, leading to a distracting
medley of full-throated excitement, that subsided only
at the masterly clarion of a rooster, angry at being disturbed.</p>

<p>The returning wagon now rumbled nearer, over flat
stones behind the barn, its heavy roar measured by the
regular, metallic clip of the horses’ well-shod hoofs.
“Git ap, there! What’re yuh doin’ there!” came the
gruff voice of his father. A loud whip-crack broke the
steady rhythm of the horses’ hoofs into an irregular gallop,
while the thunder of the wagon filled the yard with
increasing vibration.</p>

<p>Mauney ascended the stone bridge to the great double
doors, which, owing to the wind, he opened with difficulty,
and entered to grease the teeth of his saw and
hang it carefully on two spikes driven into the side of
the hay mow. He stood his axe in a corner and tossed
the pliers into an empty soap box that stood on a rough
carpenter’s bench. One of the doors, which he had left
open, now slammed shut, stirring up a stifling cloud of
chaff and rendering the interior of the barn unpleasantly
dark. In turning he stumbled over a stick of stove-wood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
used for blocking the wheels of the hay-wagon,
and fell forward. Putting, out his right hand, he
brought the palm down heavily on the sharp end of a
spike that projected from an upturned board. He regained
his feet quickly and clasped his injured hand.
It was too dark to see, but he felt a trickle of hot fluid
accumulating in his other palm. A sickening pain
mounted his arm in spirals, but he whistled a snatch
of a song, and left the barn.</p>

<p>As he passed quickly toward the kitchen, the heavy
team of Clydesdales rounded the corner of the yard,
lifting their front feet high, their heads tightly reined,
with foam blowing from their white mouths. As they
were pulled up to a stop a horse within the barn whinnied.
Then Mauney presently heard the jingle of chains
as the team were being unhitched, and in the quiet air,
his father’s voice saying:</p>

<p>“The young fellah’s gave us the slip!”</p>

<p>His brother William’s voice replied in the same disagreeable
tone: “Wonder he wouldn’t give us a hand
unhitchin.’ Fixin’ fences is easier’n spreadin’ cow dung.
Least he could do would be to throw the horses a little
hay!”</p>

<p>A warm wave of anger flushed Mauney’s face as he
halted in the middle of the yard, half determined to go
back, but his hand drove him imperatively toward the
kitchen. On the edge of the porch he relieved his boots
of adhering mud and manure on a scraper made from
an old draw-knife turned upside down between supports.
The two long upper panels of the kitchen door
were replaced by glass and draped inside by a plain cotton
curtain, through which a glow of lamp-light gave
Mauney a grateful impression of homely coziness. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
rubbing his boots on the oval verandah mat of
plaited rags, he pressed down the thumb latch and entered.</p>

<p>“Hello, Maun,” came a woman’s voice from the pantry,
half-drowned by the noise of a mechanical egg-beater.
“D’juh get the marsh fence finished?”</p>

<p>“Rome wasn’t built in a day, you remember,” he replied
as affably as his feelings allowed.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” she called above the sound, “but your
old man prob’ly thinks it didn’t take over a week.”</p>

<p>Mauney was examining his hand near the coal-oil
lamp on the kitchen table. The spike had completely
perforated his palm leaving a torn wound that still bled.
He tossed his hat to the old couch by the door and bent
nearer the lamp. Although big-bodied he had a boyish
face, filled now with youthful perplexity. The skin
over the prominent bridge of his nose had an appearance
of being tightly drawn, although his nostrils were
as sensitive as the young lips beneath them. His chin,
by its fullness, suggested a vague, personal determination
to be expected in one older, but his eyes sparkled
with that devotion of eager attention which is reserved
to youth alone.</p>

<p>He glanced toward the pantry from which the beating
sound still emerged. “Do you know what to do for
this?” he asked loudly.</p>

<p>The noise of the beater stopped.</p>

<p>“What d’juh say?”</p>

<p>“I hurt my hand and—”</p>

<p>She came forth, with her muscular arms covered by
shreds of dough, and walked to glance at his stained
hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh good God!” she exclaimed, turning away. “I
certainly do hate blood, Maun.”</p>

<p>She began rubbing the adherent dough from her
arms.</p>

<p>“Just a minute,” she said. “Go soak it in the wash
basin—here’s some warm water.” Taking a tea-kettle
from the flat-topped stove, she poured into the basin,
adding some cold water from the cistern pump.</p>

<p>As Mauney proceeded to follow her advice she rummaged
through a cotton bag, hung on the back of the
pantry door. “It’ll be all right, Maun,” she cheerfully
prophesied. “A cut like that is safe if it bleeds, but if
it don’t, watch out!”</p>

<p>She was a well-formed woman of twenty-seven, a
trifle masculine about the shoulders, but with a feminine
enough face displaying sharp, hazel eyes beneath black,
straight brows. Her nose was passably refined, but her
full lips wore a careless smile that lent not only a gleam
of golden teeth, but a mild atmosphere of coarseness to
her face. The excitement of Mauney’s injury had
called up circumscribed patches of crimson to her
cheeks and accentuated the nervous huskiness of her
voice.</p>

<p>“One time,” she continued, while she tore a white
cloth into long narrow strips, “my cousin ran a nail in
her foot. They got Doc. Horne, and he did—God only
knows what—but her foot got the size of a pungkin,
only redder.”</p>

<p>“Blood-poisoning?”</p>

<p>“Yep.”</p>

<p>As she rolled two or three crude bandages she glanced
occasionally at Mauney, with keen, appraising eyes that
followed the stretch of his broad shoulders bent over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the sink. As she nervously applied the bandage, a
moment later, the sound of boots scraping outside the
door contributed an added haste to her manner. Before
she had finished, the door opened to admit Seth
Bard.</p>

<p>Mauney’s father was of average height, but heavily
built, with ponderous shoulders and a thick, short neck.
Beneath the broad, level rim of his Stetson the lamp-light
showed the full, florid face of a man who continually
peered at life through half-closed lids in calloused,
self-confident reserve, or as if hiding what men might
read in his eyes, if he opened them. He stopped
abruptly inside the door, his thumbs caught into the
top of his trousers, and stood haughtily still for an instant,
the personification of master in his house.</p>

<p>Mauney’s back was turned toward him so that the
father could not see the occupation causing such seemingly
friendly terms between his son and his hired
woman. His narrow eyes studied them in mystification.</p>

<p>“What’s all this?” he gruffly demanded, as the face
of William appeared over his shoulder with the same inquisitive
expression.</p>

<p>“Annie’s doing up my hand,” Mauney replied calmly.</p>

<p>Bard covered the floor in long strides to glance at
the white bandage through which a red stain had already
soaked.</p>

<p>“Do it up yerself!” he commanded, seizing the
woman’s arm and pulling her away. “Where’s the supper,
Annie?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’ll be ready by the time you get some o’ the
muck off your hands,” she said, good-naturedly, as she
set about stirring a boiling pot on the stove.</p>

<p>As Mauney stood trying to adjust the dressing, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
struggled to overcome an instinct of fight, wondering
how much longer he would be able to tolerate his
father’s crude domination. Presently the woman had
the supper served and the men, having washed themselves,
were sitting down.</p>

<p>The oval table was covered with a plain yellow oil-cloth.
At the middle stood a heavy earthenware dish
filled with steaming, half-peeled potatoes, and near it,
on a folded newspaper, an agateware sauce-pan held
beet-roots. Five plates of blurred willow pattern were
piled by the father’s place, while before them a roast
of pork, with crisply-browned skin, still sizzled in its
own grease. By the woman’s place, at the opposite end,
stood a large agate tea-pot and a chunk of uncolored butter,
upon whose surface salt crystals sparkled in the
lamplight. The lamp was shaded by a sloping collar of
scorched pasteboard, while the constant flicker of the
yellow flame rendered tremulously uncertain the faces
around the board.</p>

<p>Mauney’s usual taciturnity, inspired by a feeling of
being constantly misunderstood whenever he spoke, was
increased by the pain in his hand, so that he sat in
silence, catching the conversation of the others as something
quite outside his own immediate consciousness.
He was thinking about a new book the school teacher
had loaned him.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Bard, seizing his carving knife, and
plunging his fork deep into the roast, “I guess this just
about finishes the pig, don’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yep. You’ll have to kill to-morrow,” the woman
replied, as she reached for the hired man’s tea cup. She
noticed he was nibbling at an onion, which he had taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
from his pocket. “Ain’t you afraid yer best girl will go
back on you, Snowball?” she teased.</p>

<p>“Nope,” he said with a weak-minded grin. “I d-don’t
never worry much about the women folks, so I don’t!”
He was a small-bodied, but wiry, individual of perhaps
forty-five, with a scranny, wry neck and a burnished
face of unsymmetrical design. The cervical deformity
tilted his head sidewise and gave him an appearance of
being in a constant attitude of listening, as if an unseen,
but shorter, person were always beside him whispering
in his ear. When he spoke he snapped his eyelids
as if he alertly appreciated the full significance of
his environment, and was perpetually on guard against
the wiles of his associates.</p>

<p>“Hold on, Snowball!” William said, across the table,
with a glare of mock earnestness, as he reached to sink
his knife into the butter. “You know you’re lyin’. All
the pretty gals up to Beulah is crazy about you.”</p>

<p>Snowball laughed a silent, internal kind of laugh that
caused his shoulders to rise and fall in rapid jerks to
its rhythm, and ended in its first audible accompaniment—a
sound exactly like the suction of a sink-basin
drawing in the last eddying portion of water.</p>

<p>“The gals is g-gone on you, Bill, not me!” he retorted,
with much keen winking of his lids, and entered immediately
on a second bout of noiseless, private laughter
which terminated, after the others had forgotten his remarks,
in the same astonishing sound.</p>

<p>“D’juh see the bay mare to-day, Bill?” Bard presently
inquired, across the level of a wide slice of bread, from
which he had bitten out a semi-circular portion. William
looked up knowingly from his well-loaded fork<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and nodded his head sagely with a slight lifting of his
brows, as though an intimate understanding existed.</p>

<p>“I should say so. What are you going to do with her,
Dad?” he asked.</p>

<p>Bard’s slit-like eyes narrowed even more than usual,
as for a moment, he chewed meditatively.</p>

<p>“Goin’ to get rid of her,” he said, with the careless
quickness of one pronouncing expert opinion. “Sorry I
raised her, Bill. Never liked her sire. Thompson
never had much luck with that Percheron stud. He’s
been leadin’ that horse around down the Clark Settlement,
and I seen some o’ the colts. All the same!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with the bay mare?” Mauney
enquired anxiously.</p>

<p>“She’s goin’ to be sold—that’s what’s the matter with
her!” he replied curtly. “And I don’t want to hear no
growlin’, understand me!”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t growling.”</p>

<p>“No—but you was a-thinkin’ in them terms.”</p>

<p>“Well, I thought she was mine, Dad. You gave her
to me when she was a colt. I never thought so much of
any animals as I do of her, and, more than that, I never
noticed anything wrong with her.”</p>

<p>“H’m!” sneered Bard. “You got to go into farmin’
a little deeper’n you do, to notice anything.”</p>

<p>Outside the door, the dog growled, then barked in an
unfriendly tone. The sound of a horse’s hoofs in the
lane and the squeaking of a buggy caused them to stop
eating.</p>

<p>“Dave McBratney!” William announced presently,
glancing through the window into the twilight. “I’d
know that horse if I seen it in hell.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Bard, after first loading his mouth, rose to open the
door.</p>

<p>“Good evenin’, Dave!” he said.</p>

<p>“Good night, Mr. Bard,” came a young man’s voice.
“Wait till I tie up this here hoss. He’s liable to run
away.”</p>

<p>This provoked laughter around the table which lasted
until McBratney, a tall, dashing youth with playful,
black eyes, stepped into the kitchen and greeted the
people with individual nods. A slight discoloration of
his lips indicated that he was chewing tobacco. He
wore a black, soft hat, with its rim pulled down in front,
and the tip of a peacock feather stuck into the sweat-stained
band at one side. Beneath his jacket, a grey
flannel shirt with soft collar boasted a polka-dot bow-tie
and a heavy watch chain, whose large golden links connected
two breast pockets. From the handkerchief
pocket of his coat, protruded the border of a red bandanna
and the stem of a pipe.</p>

<p>“Been up to Beulah?” William asked.</p>

<p>“Yep!”</p>

<p>“Anything new?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’ much, Bill,” replied McBratney, as he seated
himself in the low, yellow rocking-chair and began to
teeter back and forth. “The only stir is the new
preacher, I guess. I heard he was comin’ down the
Lantern Marsh this afternoon to make some calls.”</p>

<p>“I reckon that’s why you cleaned out, Dave!” said
Bard.</p>

<p>“You bet; but they say he’s quite a nice, sociable little
chap. Joe Taylor was telling me in Abe Lavanagh’s
barber shop that he seen the new preacher up at the
post office, waitin’ for the mail to be distributed. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
says he was grabbin’ right aholt o’ everybody’s paw,
just like a regular old-timer.”</p>

<p>“What’s his wife like, Dave?” Bard enquired.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Dad was sayin’ last night, it don’t
matter about the preacher so much; it all depends on
his wife, whether they’re goin’ to take with the people.”</p>

<p>“Surely,” agreed Bard. “You take McGuire who was
here before Squires. McGuire may have had his faults—I’m
not sayin’ he didn’t—but he wasn’t too bad a
little fellow at all. But that wife o’ his—why, she’d a’
ruined any man!”</p>

<p>“Lap-dogs!” laughed McBratney.</p>

<p>“Sure, and you’d a’ thought she had some kind o’
royal blood in her the way she’d strut down the sidewalk.”
Bard delved in his hip pocket for his pipe as
he pushed his chair back from the table. “A preacher’s
wife,” he continued philosophically, but with his usual
oracular impressiveness, “has got to be sort o’ human-like.
Did you hear what happened to McGuire?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Bard, his empty pipe perched between his teeth, blew
several quick blasts of air through it to clear it of sticky
contents, while he cut fine shavings of tobacco from a
plug with a large-bladed jack-knife.</p>

<p>“I was talkin’ to somebody who had been out west,”
he continued, “and McGuire was runnin’ a real estate
office, makin’ money too.”</p>

<p>McBratney reserved his comment until he had gone
to the door to spit. “That’s a nice job for a preacher
to go into, Mr. Bard,” he said, sarcastically. “I guess
he wasn’t called of the Lord.”</p>

<p>“I never blamed him!” Bard exclaimed, striking the
table with his stubby right hand, from which the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
fingers were gone. “No, sir! He showed the man in
him. But there’s just one thing more I’d a’ done!”</p>

<p>“What’s that, Dad?” William asked.</p>

<p>Bard leaned eagerly forward and clenched his fists.
“I’d a’ got that prig of a woman cornered up between
me and the end of the room, and I’d a’ choked her till
she was green in the face, and then I’d a’ handed over
all her lap-dogs an’ yellow parasols and I’d a’ shot her
right out onto the road!”</p>

<p>“You’re damned right,” approved McBratney.</p>

<p>“You bet,” agreed William Bard.</p>

<p>The humor of his master’s threat had evidently appealed
very forcibly to Snowball, for, after a few
seconds, he emitted the queer suction sound, heralding
the termination of his period of mirth.</p>

<p>A few minutes later they all left the kitchen for the
dairy shed, where the cows waited to be milked.
Mauney, disabled for milking, pumped water and carried
pails. He noticed McBratney conversing in low
tones with his brother, who occasionally turned up the
cow’s teat to sprinkle Rover with a warm spray of milk.</p>

<p>When the milking was finished, the cows were wandering
slowly back toward the pasture and William had
driven off toward Beulah with his companion, Mauney
entered the stable and unfastened the latch of a box-stall.</p>

<p>“Whoa, Jennie girl!” he said softly.</p>

<p>The mare, crunching hay, turned her head, whinnied,
and stepped over for him to come in. In the dim light
that entered from a cobwebbed window he could just
see her big eyes watching him, as he put out his hand
and stroked her sleek neck. She was his great pride,
for, since the day she had been given to him, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
watered and fed her himself, brushed and washed her
and led her to pasture. She was the only living thing
that he had regarded as his very own, but to-night he
felt uncertain about his claim. Quickly he ran his hand
over her legs, patted her chest and listened to the sound
of her breathing.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing wrong with you, Jennie, girl,” he
said as he took a fork and threw straw about the floor
of the stall.</p>

<p>It was as if he was being robbed of an old friend.
Her face haunted him as he went back to the kitchen
where his father and the woman were discussing a new
cream separator; and when he went upstairs to his room
he could see the dark eyes of his pony looking toward
him with pathetic appeal.</p>

<p>If his father and brother were studying to render his
life miserable, he thought, they would not improve on
their present success. What had he done to deserve
their constant dislike? If he picked up a book he had
learned to expect their ridicule. If he were detected in
a mood of quiet reflection, a seemingly normal occupation,
why should he have learned to expect a sarcastic
jeer? He felt that his mother, had she but lived, would
have understood better, for her nature was more like
his own.</p>

<p>In such a mood of discontent he sat idly on the edge
of his bed, striving to find some possible fault of his
own that might merit his evident ostracism. Previously,
the possession of his bay pony had given him unbelievable
comfort, for in moments of suppressed exasperation
he had gone to her stall and transferred, with gentle
pattings, the affection that he was prevented from bestowing
on his kin. “We’re old chums, aren’t we, Jennie?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Then the world would look brighter and consolation
would come to him. But the prospect of her being
sold to a stranger made him very sad.</p>

<p>Presently a horse and buggy drove up the lane and
stopped almost beneath him. Mauney opened the window
to listen, since he knew it was too early for William
to be returning.</p>

<p>“Who’s that?” he heard his father’s voice enquire.</p>

<p>“Is this where Mr. Bard lives?” enquired a strange
but cultured voice.</p>

<p>“You bet.”</p>

<p>“I’m your pastor, Mr. Bard,” the strange voice continued.
“And if you have a few moments, I’ll come
in just long enough to get acquainted. It’s a little late,
but I didn’t think you’d be in bed yet. I’ll just tie her
here, thanks. My name, as I presume you’ve heard, is
Tough, but I’m not as tough as I look.”</p>

<p>“How are yu’, Mr. Tough?”</p>

<p>“Fine, thanks.”</p>

<p>“There’s nobody here, but me an’ the hired woman—but—”</p>

<p>“No matter! I’ll take you as I find you. I understand
that Mrs. Bard died some years since.”</p>

<p>“Yes. My wife wasn’t never very strong, an’ I never
married again.”</p>

<p>“Very sad, indeed. We can’t always tell what’s behind
these things, but we try to think they happen for
a purpose.”</p>

<p>In Mauney’s breast something tightened at these
words. Dim recollections of his mother’s faded face, so
thin, but so ineffably sweet, as she closed her eyes in
their interminable rest, made him wonder if her going
had not been better than staying—staying with the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
who had looked, dry-eyed, upon her dead face! Staying
to share the unhappiness of her younger son! A
wave of joy thrilled him. For one thing he would remain
for ever glad—that his mother was dead, safely
dead—out of his father’s reach!</p>

<p>He did not know how long he had stood by the window,
but he presently heard the kitchen door open.</p>

<p>“That’s one of Tom Sunderland’s livery horses,
ain’t it, Mr. Tough?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and he’s very slow and lazy. As a matter of
fact I wanted to mention horses to you.”</p>

<p>“You ain’t got a horse o’ yer own, then?”</p>

<p>“Not yet. You might know perhaps where I could
get a reliable pony, quiet enough for Mrs. Tough?”</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Tough, maybe I might. I suppose you
want a purty good piece o’ horse flesh?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, I do.”</p>

<p>“Wife a horse fancier, Mr. Tough?”</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s fond of driving; yes.”</p>

<p>A slight pause, during which Bard coughed.</p>

<p>“It’s purty hard,” he said, clearing his throat, “to
buy a horse that’s a good roadster and at the same time
a good looker an’ quiet like; understand me.”</p>

<p>“Just so.”</p>

<p>“Now I’ve got a three-year-old mare here that ain’t
never been beat in these here parts for looks. O’ course,
I ain’t never even thought o’ sellin’ ’er. She was sired
by the best Percheron that was ever led around this section.”</p>

<p>“Something fancy, I imagine.”</p>

<p>“She lifts her feet like a lady; she’s fast, and intelligent
more’n the hired man.”</p>

<p>“What’s she worth?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Bard laughed. “Well,” he replied “I hardly know,
as I say, I never thought o’ lettin’ ’er go.”</p>

<p>“But you could give me some idea.”</p>

<p>“I know I turned down a three-hundred-dollar offer
a couple o’ months ago.”</p>

<p>The Reverend Tough whistled softly.
“The Lord’s servants,” he said, “are notoriously lacking
in the world’s goods, Mr. Bard. I fear I would
have to seek a cheaper animal.”</p>

<p>There was a well-considered pause before Bard spoke.</p>

<p>“You better come down and see her in the daylight,”
he said. “You might not want her. But I’d like to see
you with a good horse—your profession calls for it.”</p>

<p>“I think so, too.”</p>

<p>“And when it comes to that, I wouldn’t be against
knocking off, say, a hundred, if you really want her.”</p>

<p>“Really! That’s good of you. Now, look here, Mr.
Bard, I’ll come down to-morrow and see her. It’s comforting
to know that a man in these days can get a
little for love, when he hasn’t got the price.”</p>

<p>With mutual expressions of good will their conversation
ended and Mauney listened to the preacher’s buggy
squeaking down the clay road toward Beulah. He
walked to the front window of his room and watched
it until it disappeared in the mist that had blown westward
from the swamp. Then his gaze moved to the
Lantern Marsh, a grey, desolate waste under a fog
through which the moon struggled. His nature recoiled
from the hated picture.</p>

<p>Soon he slept. He dreamed of his father—and of a
warm stream of blood he could not see, but only feel
in his hands.</p>

</div>
</div>

</div>

<p>The sultry heat of the April noon rose in tremulous
vibrations from the barnyard, next day, when
for a moment, absolute silence prevailed. From beneath
his sun-splashed hat the shaded face of Bard scowled
into the blue shadow of the barn where Mauney stood
indolently biting at the end of a wisp of timothy.</p>

<p>“What are yuh mopin’ about?” Bard called sharply.
“Wake up! I don’t want no more o’ this here mopin’,
understand me. The mare is sold and that’s the end of
it. Shake a leg, there, and go hitch up Charlie. You’ve
got to drive up to Beulah an’ get this here cheque into
the bank afore it closes. D’juh hear?”</p>

<p>Past the end of the kitchen Mauney’s eye caught the
retreating figure of his pony being led up the clay road
behind the preacher’s buggy. His dishevelled auburn
hair was stuck to his glistening forehead, and his clear
blue eyes burned with an emotion that gave a bitter
firmness to his lips. Before he could pull himself from
his mood his father had come with rapid strides near
him.</p>

<p>“Are you goin’ to move?” he fiercely demanded, his
eyes glaring hatred. “Or am I goin’ to move yuh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Mauney calmly ignored his threat, while his eyes
focused indifferently on the cheque in his father’s hand.</p>

<p>“D’yuh want me to mess up yer pretty face?” fumed
Bard.</p>

<p>“I’m not just a slave of yours,” said Mauney deliberately,
with a perceptible straightening of his body, as he
turned to enter the stable door.</p>

<p>“You better move, young fellow,” said Bard, following
him. “Here, take this cheque. And mind you get
back in time to finish that fence or you’ll work in the
moon-light.”</p>

<p>Mauney drove off in a dazed state of mind, wondering
if his lot were but typical of human life in general,
or if, by some chance he had been born into an exceptionally
disagreeable home. He wondered what particular
power enabled him to bear the insulting treatment
invariably accorded him and whether that mysterious
force would always continue to serve him. He had
tried faithfully to look for likeable traits in his father’s
character. He admired his strength of purpose—that
terrible will that drove him through his long days of
labor under hot suns—and felt that he was very capable.
He knew that the farm would always be skilfully run
under his father’s guidance, but this was the full statement
of his filial faith. For beyond this cold admiration
there was no attraction, no hint of warm regard.</p>

<p>At the end of the swamp the road curved to the left
in a broad bend, giving a view of the shining tin roofs
of Beulah, on a hill two miles before him. Nearby stood
the Brick School House, with its little bell-tower, its
white picket fence, its turnstile and bare-worn playground,
the neat pile of stove-wood by the weather-stained
shed at the rear, and the two outhouses by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
corners of the lot. As he drew nearer the bell rocked
twice, giving out its laconic signal for noon recess. In
a moment a scramble of children with tin lunch-pails
poured forth, running to selected spots under the bare
maples.</p>

<p>“Hello, Mauney,” came a familiar voice from the
door as he passed.</p>

<p>“Are you going up to the village, Miss Byrne?” he
asked, lifting his hat.</p>

<p>“I’d like to?” she smiled.</p>

<p>“Come on,” he invited, cramping the horse to the
other side, that she might more conveniently enter.</p>

<p>Miss Jean Byrne was a graceful young woman whose
manner breathed unusual freshness. Her oval face possessed
a certain nun-like beauty, chiefly by reason of
her deep hazel eyes, quiet emblems of a devotional disposition.
Her good color, however, and an indulgent
fulness of lips, saved her face from an ultra-spirituality
and her low, contralto laughter neutralized a first impression
of asceticism. Mauney had never noticed that
she was really quite a large woman, although he had
been a pupil in her school for two years.</p>

<p>“How goes it, Mauney?” she asked, having noticed
an unwonted sadness in his face, usually so bright.</p>

<p>“Not too badly. I’m enjoying that book you lent
me,” he replied, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Come now—something’s wrong,” she said, searching
his face as they drove along together.</p>

<p>“I’m feeling sore to-day,” he admitted, striking the
wheel with his whip. “My father sold my pony to the
preacher, and I’m not going to forgive him. It was my
pony. He hadn’t any right to sell it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>After a pause he turned and looked into her eyes.
“I guess we all have our little troubles, Miss Byrne,
eh?”</p>

<p>She understood him. In fact Miss Byrne held him
more intimately in her quiet thoughts than he surmised,
and more intimately than their ages and contact would
have explained. She had often stood over him, during
his last term, observing the mould of his shoulders under
his loose, flannel shirt, instead of the book on his
desk. She had often lost the thread of her instructions
in the unconscious light of his blue-eyed day-dreaming.
Then, too, his English compositions had displayed such
merit that she had marvelled at his ability, and wondered
whether environment were really as strong an influence
as heredity in forming a pupil’s mind. Every
teacher who is fortunate has one pupil who becomes the
oasis in the daily desert of thankless toil, the visible reward
of seeds sown in darkness. Mauney Bard was
easily her oasis and reward. She always maintained
that there were only two classes of pupils who impressed
their teacher, the noisy, empty ones and the “dog” kind.
The canine qualities she meant were silent faithfulness
and undemonstrative affection.</p>

<p>Her wistful eyes softened with delicate sympathy as
she glanced at his clean profile, and she thought of a
sculptor’s marble. But whenever he turned toward her,
it was the trusting simplicity of a youth talking with his
mother. Mother! It was forced upon her, so that her
breast warmed with medleys of sensation.</p>

<p>“Oh, what’s wrong with your hand?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing much—I jabbed it on a nail yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you doing anything for it?”</p>

<p>“Annie’s the doctor—that’s our hired girl.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mauney Bard, you go straight to the doctor’s,” she
said. “You might lose your arm, or even your life, if
it becomes inflamed.”</p>

<p>He looked at her quizzically, and then nodded with a
smile. “All right,” he agreed.</p>

<p>The horse broke into a walk at the foot of the big
hill, leading up to the main street of Beulah. At the
top the thoroughfare with its bare archway of maples
came into view. The houses were characteristic of the
residential section, set back beyond lawns and well separated,
although here and there small grocery stores
were to be seen with well-filled windows and idle, white-aproned
proprietors. As they passed the double-windowed
front of the Beulah weekly, the blatant explosions
of a gasoline engine indicated that the journal
was on press. A little further along a lamp-post bearing
a large coal-oil lamp stood by the board side-walk, with
a signboard nailed at right angles to the street, displaying
in large black letters the name “Doctor Horne,”
while the physician’s residence, a neat stone house with
black pencilled mortar, looked out from a grove of
basswood trees.</p>

<p>“Do you know Dr. Horne?” she enquired.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>“There he is now,” she said, “He’s certainly an odd
genius. Look at the sleeves!”</p>

<p>Horne was a big, solid man of sixty, with jet-black
hair under his grey cloth cap, and jet-black, bushy eyebrows
raised airily. His neat, black moustache was
pushed forward in a mock-careless pout. He walked
with great speed, as if engrossed completely in his
thoughts, but with an air of picturesque indifference,
as if his thoughts were entirely lightsome. At intervals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
he tugged at his coat sleeves, first one and then the
other, a nervous eccentricity of no significance except
that it kept his coat cuffs near his elbows, displaying
his white shirt sleeves for the amusement of other pedestrians.
Beulah never tired of this sexagenarian bachelor.
He drove a horse as black as his own hair and
demanded the same degree of speed from it as from
himself, namely, the limit. When starting on a country
call he would jump into his buggy and race to the border
of the village, beyond which the journey was made
more leisurely, while on his return the whip was not
taken from its holder until the houses came in sight.
The Beulahite pausing on the street to watch him would
remark with a chuckle:</p>

<p>“There goes Doc. Horne, hell-for-leather!”</p>

<p>Mauney left Miss Byrne at the post-office, visited the
bank, and drove directly back to the doctor’s, hitching
his horse to the lamp-post. The office was a smaller
portion of the house at one side, which Mauney approached.
He rang the bell.</p>

<p>“Come in out of that!” immediately came the doctor’s
heavy voice.</p>

<p>Mauney stepped into an office furnished with several
leather chairs, a desk on which reposed a skull, a safe
holding on its top a stuffed loon, an open bookcase filled
with dusty volumes of various colors, and a phalanx
of bottles against one wall from which radiated a strong
odor of drugs. He looked about in vain for the doctor.</p>

<p>“Sit down, young fellow!” came a stern command
from the adjoining surgery. In a moment or two the
big physician bustled out, and, stopping in front of
Mauney’s chair, stared down at him savagely as if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
were the rankest intruder, meanwhile smoking furiously
and surrounding himself with blue cigar smoke.</p>

<p>“Say!” he said, at length, jerking the cigar roughly
from his mouth. “Who the devil are you?”</p>

<p>“Mauney Bard!”</p>

<p>“Oh, God, yes! Of course you are. Of course you
are!” Horne spluttered, walking impulsively to the bookcase
and rivetting his attention on the binding of a book.</p>

<p>“So you’re one of Seth Bard’s curses, eh?” he said,
at length, in a preoccupied tone, with his back still
turned to Mauney. “Been fighting?”</p>

<p>“No, doctor, I ran a nail in my hand,” he replied,
with a smile.</p>

<p>Horne shuffled a pace to his left to transfer his keen
attention to another bookbinding, which so completely
absorbed him that Mauney was sure he had forgotten
his patient. After what seemed five minutes, Horne
turned about and, going to his desk, plumped himself
down into a swivel-chair. His eye-brows nearly touched
the line of his hair as his black eyes stole to the corner
of his lids in a sly study of his patient.</p>

<p>“Nail eh? Rusty?”</p>

<p>Mauney commenced undoing the bandage.</p>

<p>“Hip! Hip!” admonished Horne. “I didn’t tell you
to take that off. Wait till I tell you, young fellow. Lots
of time. Rusty?”</p>

<p>“Yes, doctor.”</p>

<p>“Come in here!”</p>

<p>Horne jumped up and went into the surgery. He
quickly cut away the crude bandage and merely glanced
at the wound.</p>

<p>“Soreness go up your arm, young fellow?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a little bit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“Uh—Hum!”</p>

<p>Horne clasped his arms behind his back and stamped
dramatically up and down the surgery, rattling the instruments
in their glass case by the wall. Suddenly he
faced Mauney.</p>

<p>“How would you like to lose your arm, young man?”
he asked seriously.</p>

<p>“I’d hate to.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m going to open up that wound freely,” he
said, walking toward the instrument case. “Do you
want to take chloroform?”</p>

<p>“No—I think I can stand it.”</p>

<p>Home selected a knife and pulling a hair out of his
head tried its edge.</p>

<p>“She’s sharp—damned sharp!” he remarked, dropping
the instrument into a basin of solution. “You think you
can stand it, eh? Remember, I offered you chloroform.”</p>

<p>Presently he picked the knife out of the basin.</p>

<p>“Come here, you. Put your hand in that solution.
Hold it there a minute. Does it nip?”</p>

<p>Mauney nodded.</p>

<p>“Well, let it nip. Now take your hand out. Stand
up straight. Hold it out here.”</p>

<p>Horne pressed the blade deeply into the tissues, then
withdrew it. Looking up into his patient’s face:</p>

<p>“Did you feel it?”</p>

<p>“Just a little, Doctor,” said Mauney, biting his lip.</p>

<p>“Don’t you faint, Bard!”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to.”</p>

<p>“Yes you are!”</p>

<p>“I am not!” insisted Mauney as the color returned to
his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>While the doctor put on a fresh dressing his manner
altered. He whistled a snatch of a country dance.</p>

<p>“You look like your mother, boy,” he said more
gently. “I looked after your poor mother. You were
just a young gaffer then. She was a very fine woman.
She was too damned good for your old man. I’ve told
Seth that before now.”</p>

<p>“Will this need to be dressed again?” Mauney asked,
as they later stood in the waiting room.</p>

<p>“Yes. On Saturday.”</p>

<p>Horne’s attention was drawn to the figure of a woman
approaching the office.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he said softly. “Surely Sarah Tenent isn’t
sick. I’ll bet she’s peddling bills for the revival services.”</p>

<p>The bell rang.</p>

<p>“All right, come in, Mrs. Tenent.”</p>

<p>“How do you do, doctor?” she said, very deferentially,
as she entered.</p>

<p>“Just about as I choose, Mrs. Tenent,” he replied
coldly, watching her minutely.</p>

<p>She took a large white paper notice from a pile on
her arm.</p>

<p>“Will you serve the Lord,” she asked with great
soberness, “by hanging this in your office, doctor?”</p>

<p>He glanced over it and read aloud, very hurriedly:
“Revival Services, Beulah Church, commencing Sunday.
Rev. Francis Tooker and Rev. Archibald Gainford, successful
evangelists, will assist the new pastor, Rev. Edmund
Tough. Special Singing. Come.”</p>

<p>He passed it back to her and shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, no—not here, I’d never hang it here. I have
patients who are not of thy fold, Mrs. Tenent. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
function is to cure the sick. That sign would make
some of them sicker. No, no.”</p>

<p>The woman left the office in silent disapproval of
Horne’s attitude. Mauney put on his hat and was leaving
the office, when the doctor appeared in the door behind
him.</p>

<p>“Hold on, young chap!” he commanded. “Wait you!
Didn’t I see you driving into the village with a young
lady?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think you noticed us,” laughed Mauney.</p>

<p>“Who was she?”</p>

<p>“Miss Byrne. She teaches at the Brick School.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes. Of course she does. Fine young lady,”
he said, studying Mauney with much lifting of his brows
and pouting of his lips. “But you’re too young, Bard.
Why don’t you get somebody your own age?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” Mauney said quickly, while his face flushed;
“She’s probably got a beau. It isn’t me, anyway, doctor.”</p>

<p>Horne, greatly amused at the emotional perturbation
of his patient, chuckled, while his black eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>“Get along with you, Bard!” he said, “Get along home
with you and don’t forget to come up on Saturday,
mind!”</p>

<p>The revival meetings became the talk of the countryside.
Beulah, composed for the most part of retired
farmers, had unusual leisure in which to think—a leisure
captured by the glamor of religion, which was the
strongest local influence. Although the village was a
century old it had preserved, with remarkable success,
the puritanism of the pioneer period, partly because it
enjoyed so little touch with the commercial energies of
the nation at large, and partly because the local churches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
had remained diligent in spiritual service. But in a
population so uniformly composed of idle folk, the
general view-point lay itself open to become biased.
There was too much emphasis on the ghostly estate and
too little on the need of practical endeavor. Beulah had
forgotten long since that the Church must have its
lost world, else it becomes unnecessary, and to the average
citizen, lulled as he was by surfeit of beatific meditation,
the board sidewalks had begun to take on an
aureate tinge, the houses, a pearly lustre. The spiritual
concern of the religiously eager Beulahite had in it,
unfortunately, no concept of national character, but was
pointed sharply at the individual. His sense of personal
security was only less unhealthy than his over-bearing
interest in the soul welfare of his neighbor.
Saved by repeated redemptions himself, he remained
strangely skeptical of the validity of the phenomenon in
others. Hence, at fairly regular intervals, a general village
consciousness of sin developed, becoming insistently
stronger until it found its logical expression—the revival
meeting.</p>

<p>Mauney, during the next week, listened to the religious
talk of the community with mild curiosity. Mrs.
McBratney, the pious mother of David, said to him one
afternoon from the side of her buggy:</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll attend the revival meetings, Mauney.
Your mother would want you to go. We are praying
for great things.</p>

<p>“I’ve been on my knees for the young people,” she
continued, “and I believe David has got conviction.”</p>

<p>Tears suddenly filled her eyes and her chin quivered
with such tremulous emotion as to embarrass Mauney,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
who could fancifully imagine that David had been smitten
by a plague.</p>

<p>“I believe he will be converted,” she managed to say,
before her voice broke into a sob, “and I pray the Lord
will show you the light, too, Mauney.”</p>

<p>He felt that perhaps it would have been good form to
say “Thank you,” for he was sure her intentions were
sterling, but he resented her reference to his mother,
who seemed to him, in memory, a creature too much of
sunshine and peace to be associated with anything so
dolefully emotional.</p>

<p>He had never been a regular attendant at church. He
remembered having sat beside his mother many times
in the auditorium listening to unintelligible sermons and
strenuous anthems. But from the day, five years ago,
when as a chief mourner he had sat blankly stupefied,
hearing comforting words that failed to comfort, and
music whose poignant solemnity froze him with horrid
fear, he had never been invited either by desire or family
suggestion to return.</p>

<p>By the second week of the meetings David McBratney
was reported to have been converted. He had
stopped coming to see William as had been his custom.
Neighbors said there could be no doubting the genuineness
of his reformation for he had ceased chewing
tobacco and was contemplating entry into the ministry
of the Church. During supper at the Bard farm on
Saturday evening a lull in the conversation was broken
by a sarcastic laugh from William.</p>

<p>“Well, Dad, I guess they’ve got Dave,” he said. “Abe
Lavanagh was tellin’ me to-day that Dave has went
forward every night this here week. I never figured
he’d get religion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Bard philosophically chewed on the idea as he peered
at the lamp through his narrow eyes.</p>

<p>“There is just two kinds of people,” he asserted at
length. “The fools and the damned fools. Now there’s
a boy who’s got every chance of inheriting his old man’s
farm. And I’m tellin’ you, Bill, it’s a purty good piece
o’ land.”</p>

<p>“You bet.”</p>

<p>“Just about as good as is bein’ cultivated this side of
Lockwood. There ain’t a stone left in the fields, but
what’s piled up in the fences. William Henry has slaved
this here thirty years—got the mortgage cleaned up—and
that barn o’ his, Bill, why you couldn’t build it to-day
for five thousand!”</p>

<p>“No, nor six, Dad.”</p>

<p>“Then look at the machinery the old man’s got. I’m
tellin’ yuh Dave ain’t goin’ to drop into nothing like
that, agin. William Henry must be seventy!”</p>

<p>“May be seventy-one, Dad.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow he ain’t goin’ to last a great while longer.
If I was Dave I’d forget this religion business. ’Taint
goin’ to get him nowhere. Ain’t that right, Snowball?”</p>

<p>The hired man, having finished supper, was sitting
back drowsily, but at the sound of his name he winked
his eyes cautiously.</p>

<p>“I dunno,” he said, “I don’t never bother much about
religion, so I don’t!”</p>

<p>In Dr. Horne’s office that week the subject of the revival
came up while Mauney was having his hand
dressed.</p>

<p>“Some queer people here in this one-horse town!”
mused Horne. “Do you remember George Pert who
died a couple or three years ago?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lived down by the toll-gate?”</p>

<p>“That’s him. Lazy as twelve pigs. Use to lie abed
till noon. Wife kept a market garden. Never paid his
doctor’s bills. Yes, sir! George Pert! He got a cancer
of the bowel, poor devil. Sick. Pretty far gone. I
went in one day and found preacher Squires sitting by
the bed. ‘Well, Mr. Pert,’” (Horne’s voice assumed an
amusing clerical solemnity) “‘Are you trusting in the
Lord?’ George nods his head. ‘Yes’ says he, ‘I’m so
sartin o’ salvation, that if only one person in Beulah is
going to heaven I know it’s me!’</p>

<p>“They’re a nosey bunch, here!” Horne continued, as
he wound a bandage on Mauney’s hand. “Self-satisfied!
Let your light so shine—good! But don’t focus
your light into a red-hot spot to burn out your neighbor’s
gizzard. Last night Steve Moran came into the
office and sat down. ‘Doctor’ says he, ‘I just came in
to see if your feet were resting on the Rock.’ Says I,
‘Steve, you blackguard, you owe me five dollars from
your wife’s last confinement, fifteen years ago. If you
don’t go to hell out o’ here, you’ll be resting in a long
black box!’”</p>

<p>Mauney was surprised how much people talked about
the revival. Enthusiasts carried out from the meetings,
by their words and manner, an infectious fervor that
directed the curious attention of others to the thing that
was happening night by night in the Beulah church.
Finally, on Sunday evening, he decided to see it for
himself and drove to town. The church sheds were
filled to overflowing so that he tied old Charlie to a
fence post in the yard. Through the colored windows
he heard the voluminous roar of voices lifted in the
cadence of a hymn. The church was crowded. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
vestry at the entrance was full of waiting people and,
through one of the doors leading to the auditorium, he
glimpsed a sea of heads. At the farther end of the
great room, in a low gallery, sat the choir, facing him,
and below them on the pulpit platform three preachers
were seated in red plush chairs. The seated congregation
were singing an unfamiliar hymn whose rhythm
reminded him of march music he had heard bands playing
in Lockwood. Ushers were carrying in chairs to
accommodate the overflow.</p>

<p>David McBratney, carrying an armful of red hymn
books touched Mauney on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Here’s a book,” he whispered, proffering one. “I’ll
get you a seat in a few minutes. Glad to see you here,
Mauney.”</p>

<p>McBratney’s face glowed with a strange luminosity,
puzzling to Mauney, and his speech and manner were
quickened by nervous tension. Presently he led the way
to a chair in the aisle.</p>

<p>At the end of a stanza one of the preachers jumped
suddenly to his feet and interrupted the organ.</p>

<p>“You’re not half singing!” he shouted angrily. “You
can do better than that. If you haven’t more voice than
that, how do you expect the Lord to hear your words of
praise? Now, on the next stanza, let yourself out.
Ready!”</p>

<p>He raised both arms high above his head and, as the
organ commenced, brought them to his side with such
force that he was compelled to take a step forward to
regain his balance. His words had the effect he desired,
for a deafening volume of sound rose and fell quickly
to the lilt of the march-music, suggesting to Mauney the
image of neatly-uniformed cadets with stiffened backs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and even steps, moving along Lockwood streets on a
holiday.</p>

<p>When the hymn ended, a soft hand touched
Mauney on the arm and, looking to his right, he saw
Jean Byrne seated in the end of the oaken pew directly
next to him. She was just letting her closed hymnal
drop into her lap.</p>

<p>“Glad to see you,” she whispered, guarding her lips
with her gloved hand.</p>

<p>One of the preachers rose slowly from his chair. He
was a stout man of fifty, mild-appearing and pleasant,
with clean-shaven face and grey hair. He walked forward
to the edge of the carpeted platform, rested his
elbow on the side of the pulpit and raised his face to
gaze slowly over the quieting congregation. “My dear
friends,” he said in soft, silver tone, “I thank God for
the hymn we have just been singing. It has been indeed
very inspiring. Brother Tooker and myself have been
in your little town for two weeks now, and have grown
so fond of the people that we view to-night’s meeting
with inevitable feelings of regret, because, so far as we
can see the divine guidance, it will be our last night with
you. But we have also feelings of hope, because we
are praying that there may be a great turning to God
as a result of this meeting.”</p>

<p>As he paused to shift his weight slowly to his other
foot and clasp his hands behind his frock coat, the congregation
was silent. Only the sound of a horse stamping
in the shed could be heard.</p>

<p>“During our fortnight with you,” he continued, “many
souls have been led to the Cross. We thank God for
that. But there are many more who are still living in
sin—some of them are here to-night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>As his glance shifted over the mass of upturned faces,
Mauney fancied he paused perceptibly as he looked his
way.</p>

<p>“It is to you, who are in sin, that we bring a message
of hope. You have only to take God at his word, who
sent His Son to save that which was lost.”</p>

<p>“Amen!” came a vigorous response from an old man
in the front pew.</p>

<p>“You have only to believe on Him who is righteous
and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from
all unrighteousness.”</p>

<p>“Amen!” from near the back.</p>

<p>“Amen!” also, from the side, half-way up.</p>

<p>At this juncture a woman in the body of the auditorium
burst forth, in good voice, singing the first verse
of “Though your sins be as scarlet,” whereat the
preacher indulgently acquiesced, and waved for the congregation
to join her. At the end of the first stanza he
raised his hand.</p>

<p>“The lesson for to-night is taken from the first chapter
of the beloved Mark.” As he carefully read the
passage of scripture the ushers were busy leading in
more people, so that, when he finished, the floor was entirely
filled save for two narrow aisles, one on either
side, leading from the back to the altar railing.</p>

<p>The Reverend Francis Tooker, as he walked confidently
forward, was seen to be tall and thin, with a
long, florid face and a great mass of stiff, black hair.
He raised his large, bony hand.</p>

<p>“Let every head be bowed!” he commanded, sharply.</p>

<p>After a short invocation he commenced his discourse.
He dealt at length with the experiences of the prodigal
son, pictured in adequate language the depths of profligacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
to which he had sunk, stressed the moment of
his decision to return home, and waxed touchingly eloquent
over the reception which his father accorded him.</p>

<p>“And now, people,” he said more brusquely, as he
slammed shut the big pulpit Bible and ran his long fingers
nervously through his hair. “You’ve got a chance
to do what that boy did. You’ve been acting just the way
he acted—don’t dare deny it! You’ve been wallowing
in the dirt with the pigs, and you’re all smeared up.
What are you going to do about it?”</p>

<p>The audience, keyed up to the former flow of his unfaltering
eloquence, were now mildly shocked by the
informality of his pointed question. He walked to the
very edge of the platform while his eyes grew savage
and his face red.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do about it?” he shouted,
clenching his fists and half-squatting. Then, rising
quickly, he hastened to the other side of the pulpit.
“Are you going to arise and go to your Father? Or
are you going to keep on mucking about with the pigs?
Don’t forget that for anyone of you this night may be
your last. To-night, perhaps you” (he pointed), “or
you,” (he pointed again) “may be required to face God.
What are you going to do about it? Are you going
to die forgiven of your sins like a man, or are you going
to shut your ears to the word of God and die like any
other pig?”</p>

<p>No sound interrupted the intense silence. No one
moved. Even the flickering lamps seemed to steady
their illumination to a glaring, yellow uniformity.</p>

<p>Suddenly his manner altered. Moving to a position
behind the pulpit he rested his elbows on the Bible and
folded his hands together out over the front edge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the book-rest, while his voice assumed a quiet, conversational
tone.</p>

<p>“Remember that on this night, the twentieth day of
April, 1914, you were given an opportunity to come
out full-breasted for God. I have discharged my duty.
The rest remains for you to do. If you are sorry for
your sins, say so. If you regret the kind of life you’ve
been leading, confess it. Come out and get washed off
clean. The invitation is open. The altar awaits to receive
you.”</p>

<p>As he pointed to the altar railing, his black eyes
flashed hypnotically.</p>

<p>“Those who have sinned, but are repentant and seek
redemption, please stand.”</p>

<p>For about ten seconds a great inertia possessed the
seated congregation. Then two men stood up near the
front of the pews, followed soon after by groups of both
men and women in various parts of the auditorium,
until, at length, only a sporadic rising here and there
marked a new mood of hesitancy.</p>

<p>“While the choir sings,” the preacher said softly, “I
will ask you to steal away to the foot of the altar. The
choir will please sing the first two verses of ‘Come Ye
Disconsolate,’ and you who have, by standing, thus signified
your desire for salvation, will move quietly forward
and kneel by the railing.”</p>

<p>As the slow, full chords of the hymn began the
preacher’s voice kept calling “Come away, Brother,” and
the standing penitents sought the narrow aisles and
moved slowly forward to kneel with their heads touching
the oaken railing. The Rev. Archibald Gainford
and the Rev. Edmund Tough descended from the platform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
to the crescent-shaped altar space and, bending
down, spoke words of comfort to the suppliants.</p>

<p>As the choir stopped and the organ notes faded, the
exhorter produced a silver watch and examined it, hurriedly.</p>

<p>“If we had more time,” he said, “how many more
would like to come forward? Please stand.”</p>

<p>A dozen or more rose to their feet.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, with a smile, as he returned his
watch to his pocket, “we have plenty of time. Come
out, brother!”</p>

<p>Caught by this subtle snare, many of the presumably
wavering individuals found it impossible to refuse his
invitation, while a few sat down again.</p>

<p>When the meeting eventually drew to a close, after a
long hymn, sung with the same exciting rhythm as the
first one, Mauney rose with the rest and moved impatiently
toward the door, walking beside Jean Byrne
and talking to her of obvious matters. Her face, he
noticed, was flushed and her eyes shining with unusual
brightness from delicately moist lids, while her voice
seemed husky and uncertain. The auditorium emptied
slowly. The steps leading down from the front doorway
to the walk presented the customary Sunday night
groups of village beaux waiting to accompany their
sweethearts home, or perhaps stroll with them through
quiet, moonlit streets.</p>

<p>Beulah village council, anxious to keep taxes at a
minimum, had never provided street-lighting, so that
pedestrians, on dark nights, carried lanterns, unless they
were lovers, in which case they relied either on moonlight
or familiarity with the local geography.</p>

<p>Jean Byrne had come to the village in the buggy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Mr. and Mrs. Fitch with whom she boarded on the Lantern
Marsh road, but Mauney, being alone, invited her
to drive down with him. She accepted and soon they
were off together.</p>

<p>“I could have kicked over a pew in there to-night,”
said Mauney at length, tersely.</p>

<p>“I knew you wouldn’t like it,” she said. “Personally
I think it’s very unreal. Perhaps some people derive
good from it, though.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. But it hasn’t any connection with real
life, Miss Byrne. I can’t help feeling you’ve got to let
the common daylight into things.”</p>

<p>“That’s good.”</p>

<p>“It’s easy enough to see how they get pulled into it,”
he went on. “There’s a sort of excitement about it. I
don’t think one person by himself could get so excited.”</p>

<p>“You mean there’s a mob consciousness?”</p>

<p>“Yes, exactly—a lot of minds rubbing each other,
like.”</p>

<p>“I believe you’ve hit it, Mauney,” she said. “I never
thought of it like that before. How did you manage to
think that out?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve always noticed, if I’m in a crowd, that
it’s hard for me to stay just as I am when I’m alone.
Now, I hate people who are always chirping like chipmunks—you’ll
meet them at socials and dances. They
don’t say anything that matters and might better keep
their mouths shut. But if I get with them I’ll notice
how it affects me, for after I leave I feel sort of weak.”</p>

<p>“You must enjoy observing things like that, Mauney.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t enjoy it,” he replied. “That’s just what
I’m up against the whole time at home. My father and
brother and the hired girl keep up an endless rattle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
talk, all the time, about things that aren’t important. I
keep quiet on purpose because I don’t want to talk
about them.”</p>

<p>“What sort of things do they discuss?”</p>

<p>“Oh—the price of eggs, what somebody did with a
certain horse, who married so-and-so and who she was
before she did it, and whether the preacher’s wife is
human, and then they’re always teasing Snowball; but
he isn’t such a fool as they think he is.”</p>

<p>For a moment Miss Byrne studied Mauney’s face,
bright with moonlight.</p>

<p>“Well, what kind of things do you think are important?”
she asked. “I mean what would you like to discuss,
if you had your own way at home?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t say exactly,” he said, reflectively. “But
I’m discontented all the time, and feel ignorant. I want
an education. I’m interested in history, most.”</p>

<p>While she listened to his words, Miss Byrne was enjoying
the landscape as they drove slowly along. It
was no new thing for her to feel fresh attractions toward
Mauney, but to-night, for some reason that she
did not seek, she felt uncomfortably warm toward him,
and presently her soft, gloved hand pressed his hand
tenderly, and remained holding it. It came as a surprise
to him, and he glanced quickly at her face, across
which the sharp shadow of her hat formed a line just
above her lips. He could distinguish her eyes turned
away in the direction of the moonlit fields she was admiring,
and her pretty lips, vivid and tender, sent a
strange thrill through his body. Although he made no
effort to draw away his hand, he disliked the situation
as something he could not grasp. Lying helplessly captured,
his fingers felt the heat of her hand. She had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
stopped talking and he noticed her bosom moving as
deeply as if she were asleep, but more quickly. He
had the same feeling, for an instant, as in the meeting,
of an outside power insidiously exciting his mind, but
noticed with a definite sense of relief that they were
nearing Fitch’s gate. In a moment he freed his hand
from hers and pulled up the horse.</p>

<p>“Mauney!”</p>

<p>She spoke his name in a low, unsteady voice and
pressed her hand against his arm. That she was not
warning him of some sudden obstacle in their way, was
clear, for, on looking toward the road, he saw nothing.
When he turned to her, her hat was hiding her bowed
face and her hand was relaxing slowly—so very slowly—and
falling from his arm. The emotion that caused
her breathing to be broken by queer, jerky pauses mystified him.</p>

<p>“Are you ill, Miss Byrne?” he ventured to ask, and
noticed that his own voice was tremulous.</p>

<p>She shook her head slowly and began to climb out of
the buggy. “No, Mauney boy,” she replied softly. “I
was just lonesome, I guess. Goodnight!” He was puzzled.
As he drove along he grew exceedingly impatient.
There were so many things, he thought, beyond his
comprehension.</p>

<p>When he reached home, Mauney found his father
talking in the kitchen with William Henry
McBratney while the hired girl lay on the sofa with the
cat asleep on her bosom. His father, seated with his
socked feet resting on the stove damper and his chair
tilted back, looked up as he entered from the yard.</p>

<p>“Well,” he addressed him, “I hope to God you didn’t
get it.”</p>

<p>“Get what?” asked Mauney, surprised at being
noticed, and irked by his father’s abrupt manner.</p>

<p>“You wasn’t in a place where you’d be likely to get a
bottle of whiskey, was you?” Bard quickly responded.</p>

<p>“Oh—you mean religion, Dad?”</p>

<p>Without further acknowledgment of Mauney’s presence
than a sarcastic motion of his head, Bard addressed
his neighbor.</p>

<p>“I guess that’s about all he’d get up to Beulah church,
ain’t it, William Henry?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, that’s about the size of it, Seth!” admitted
McBratney, smacking the arm of the chair with his
bony palm, as if one would naturally expect to get a
variety of commodities at Beulah church. He possessed
an evil, circular face, with gray hair falling untidily over
a low forehead. His long, thin legs seemed largest at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the knee-joints as he sat with difficulty in the low rocking-chair,
and his long, brown neck, with its prominent
Adam’s apple, gave his small, ball-like head an unreal
appearance of detachment. When he spoke, in his high-pitched,
rasping voice, his Adam’s apple shifted up and
down his throat as if it were a concealed bucket bringing
the words up from his body.</p>

<p>“That’s about the size of it, I tell yuh!” he repeated.
“And when they get religion, Seth, why there ain’t no
good tryin’ to drill any reason into ’em!”</p>

<p>Mauney stood in the door leading to the former dining-room,
watching McBratney’s small eyes shine with
wicked animation.</p>

<p>“As I was tellin’ yuh,” he went on, “the woman
wouldn’t let up on him, day ner night, pesterin’ the life
out o’ the boy, goin’ into her room there off the kitchen
an prayin’ like she was tryin’ to ward off a cyclone.”</p>

<p>He suddenly bent forward, so that his long hands
nearly touched the floor, suggesting to Mauney an enraged
orang-outang looking through the bars of his
circus cage.</p>

<p>“An’ now that she’s got her way, what do you think?”</p>

<p>Bard knocked the bowl of his pipe against the edge
of the stove.</p>

<p>“God only knows! What?” he said.</p>

<p>“Dave’s made up his mind to go preachin’!”</p>

<p>“I heard that,” admitted Bard with a sly smile. “I
s’pose you’ll be proud to have a son o’ yours called of
the Lord, eh?”</p>

<p>“Called o’ nothing!” declared McBratney, hammering
the chair arm with his fist, then settling back, with much
silent movement of his Adam’s apple. “I’ve tried to
reason with him, but his mind is stopped workin’ or else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
it’s workin’ just a little bit too fast fer me. I think he’s
just framin’ an excuse to leave the farm.”</p>

<p>“Give him a few weeks, William Henry,” suggested
Bard. “He may get over this here frenzy o’ his. Dave
always struck me as a purty sharp lad an’ I reckon it’s
only temporary, like.”</p>

<p>The hired girl looked up from her idle occupation of
stroking the cat’s fur.</p>

<p>“Many folks out to church, Maun?” she asked.</p>

<p>Bard, as though he resented her speaking to his son,
made a gesture toward the table.</p>

<p>“Here, Annie,” he said authoritatively, “Go cut up a
loaf o’ bread and set out a bowl of preserves. Me and
William Henry is goin’ to have a bite to eat.”</p>

<p>Up in his own room, Mauney later tried to read a
small book Miss Byrne had given him. It was a leather-bound
copy of Thomas à Kempis. He wondered why
she had chosen such a gift, for the subject matter was
too cloistral. Tossing it aside, he picked up an Ancient
History she had recently loaned him and became absorbed
in it until he was able to forget some of the
things that rankled in his breast, among others, Jean
Byrne’s peculiar manner in the buggy. Lying with his
head propped on a pillow he read until his eyes ached.
In fancy he lived in ancient palaces among courtiers
and councillors, saw the regalia of royal fêtes, through
which came the sound of war trumpets. He read of
ambitious sculptors whose names were written on the
roster of deathless fame and saw steel engravings of
their work—headless, armless torsos, nicked and cracked
by the ravage of centuries. He saw conquerors leading
stalwart armies, deciding the fate of nations. The story
held him to the last page and he saw that the aspirations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of a mighty nation were dead; the rising star of ambition
was quenched in its ascent; and only a vast pile
of melancholy tokens remained to interest scholars who
delved with spades. And he went to sleep in great
wonderment as to what it all signified.</p>

<p>A few days later he took the Ancient History to return
it to Miss Byrne. As he approached Fitch’s gate
on foot, he heard Jean’s low laughter, and on passing
between the lilac hedges, saw her on the front verandah
with Mrs. Fitch.</p>

<p>“Good evening,” he said, “you both seem to be enjoying
yourselves.”</p>

<p>“Come and sit down, Mauney. Mrs. Fitch has just
been convulsing me with a story from real life,” she
invited, her eyes red from laughter. “What have you
been doing to-day?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the same old stuff,” he replied, nodding slyly
towards Mrs. Fitch, busy with long, white knitting-needles.
“I thought I’d stroll over and hear the latest
scandal.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Fitch was a woman of fifty, with scrupulously
tidy grey hair, a square jaw, silver spectacles and thin
lips suggesting latent deviltry.</p>

<p>“Wal, Maun,” she said, without looking up from her
rapidly-interplying ivory-points, “we ain’t <em>accurate</em> scandal-mongers.
Not the kind that talk about folks for
the sake of harmin’ them. But things do strike us peculiar
like, at times, and gives our livers a healthy shakin’
up. I’ve just been telling Miss Byrne about the young
Hawkins brat.” She paused and cast a sharp glance
over the tops of her glasses. “You know him?” she
asked.</p>

<p>Mauney nodded and smiled, for it was common knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
that the son of Miss Lizzy Hawkins could not
claim, with any degree of accuracy, the paternal factor
of respectability enjoyed by most children.</p>

<p>“Wal,” she resumed, her eyes returning to the line
of her knitting, “young Hawkins was a-playin’ in the
road out here after school. Along comes William Henry
McBratney drivin’ the old, grey horse. He sees the
Hawkins boy and he pulls up and he says, says ’e,
‘Where’s your father, you young brat!’ Young Hawkins,
of course, didn’t know him—hasn’t brains enough
to know anybody, but, after a minute of heavy thinkin’
he looks up at McBratney and he says, says ’e, ‘Maw
told me, me father was down in South Americky workin’
on a steam roller, but I heard her tellin’ me grandmother
as how me father’s name is William Henry McBratney!’”</p>

<p>Mauney laughed as Mrs. Fitch soberly glanced over
her spectacles again.</p>

<p>“And then,” she resumed, “old William Henry leans
half out of his buggy, waving his whip and shouting,
without knowing as how he had an audience: ‘Tell yer
mother to keep her damned mouth shut, you brat!’</p>

<p>“I guess it’s true enough,” she went on presently, pulling
a string of yarn from the revolving ball in her
lap. “And then people talk about Dave McBratney for
getting converted. It was the best thing he ever done!
If I was a son of William Henry’s I’d get converted
before you could say Jack Robinson.”</p>

<p>Mauney had never so little enjoyed talking with
Jean Byrne as to-night. The episode of Sunday
evening had left a distasteful flavor in his mind, for,
although he tried to forget it, the incident kept flashing
back upon his memory. He was left alone on the verandah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
with her presently, and immediately felt an awkwardness,
hard to overcome. Hitherto, she had always
been just his teacher. But to-night, dressed in a yellow-flowered
frock, with a pale yellow ribbon holding her
dark hair down on her brow, she had lost a quality of
dignity. He noticed also a hundred fine lights of tenderness
in her eyes that he had never seen before.</p>

<p>He talked with her a few minutes and gave back the
history.</p>

<p>“Let me get you another book,” she said, starting toward
the door.</p>

<p>“Please don’t bother—just now, Miss Byrne,” he said.</p>

<p>“Why not, Mauney?”</p>

<p>“I’m so busy I haven’t time to read,” he lied.</p>

<p>He thought afterward that in that moment when he
refused to accept her kindness she divined perfectly
the underlying feeling. It was his last conversation
with Jean Byrne. He went home quite sadly. There
was no surfeit of comforts in that home of his, to be
sure, which could render him careless of helpful friendships:
but, although he felt the significance of refusing
her offer, knowing it meant the end of things between
them, his sadness was over the seeming weakness in
her that had caused his dislike. He might not have
been so astonished at other women. But of Jean Byrne
he had expected differently.</p>

<p>His life in the Lantern Marsh thus robbed of one
more brightness became the more uninteresting. He
felt the need of companionship. Struggling through
long days, of planting, sowing, and haying, he forced
back the tug of expanding desires that urged him to
different pursuits. In the evenings he would stand looking
down the road that led to Lockwood, wishing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
he were travelling it never to return. To Lockwood, to
Merlton beyond, to the world. He dreamed of a different
life from his own, where people were gentle,
where they knew things and would be willing to teach
him out of their knowledge. But these dreams were
folded to rest each night in heavy sleep and the light of
each morning found them dissipated. He wanted books,
but there was no library in Beulah. He had no money
of his own and knew the foolishness of asking his
father for it.</p>

<p>At the end of June, Jean Byrne returned to her home
in Lockwood, and Mrs. Fitch remarked to him one day
that she was not coming back, but was going to be
married in the autumn to a doctor in her own town.
Mrs. Fitch was curious, no doubt, to discover a reason
for Mauney’s never having come back to see her again.</p>

<p>“Miss Byrne was a good teacher, Maun,” she said,
as they talked in the Beulah post-office, “and I think
she was powerful fond o’ you, boy. She told me onct
as how she expected you would some day make your
mark in the world.”</p>

<p>Mauney felt tears welling into his eyes and turned
away from her without further comment. He drove
home blaming himself for having been rude to Jean
Byrne. Her confidence in him, expressed through Mrs.
Fitch, had come as sharp reward for his ingratitude.
And yet, was it his fault?</p>

<p>On a sultry July evening an unexpected break in the
monotony of his life occurred. He was sitting alone on
the front steps of the farm-house, having just come in
from the fields, when his attention was attracted by a
cloud of dust on the Lockwood road. A motor car was
travelling rapidly along and as it drew near, slackened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
its speed. When it stopped directly at the foot of the
orchard he surmised the people in it had paused for
directions. A woman in the back seat waved to him
and he quickly responded.</p>

<p>They were all strangers, the man at the wheel and
the two women in the rear seat, although he felt there
was something quite familiar about the grey-haired
woman sitting nearest him.</p>

<p>“Is this where the Bards live?” she asked a little nervously.
She was a small-bodied woman of perhaps fifty
with very fine features, and clear, blue eyes that smiled
pleasantly through rimless spectacles and the fawn
motor veil that covered her face.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Mauney replied, gazing curiously at her, and
then at the others.</p>

<p>The man, chewing the end of an unlighted cigar,
looked at the house with a frown and then glancing
backward said in a low tone:</p>

<p>“Well, suit yourself, Mary. You might regret it if
you didn’t.”</p>

<p>The woman, presumably his wife, looked with an undecided
expression toward the house, as if she feared it.</p>

<p>“Is your name Bard, please?” she asked, raising her
veil, and minutely inspecting Mauney’s face.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, glancing again at the others.</p>

<p>“He looks the dead image of her!” the other woman
remarked prosaically to the man.</p>

<p>“And are you Mauney?” asked his interlocutor.</p>

<p>His brow was puckered with a dawning idea that soon
caused his face to brighten up.</p>

<p>“Are you my Aunt Mary?” he asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>“How did you know?”</p>

<p>He came nearer and took her extended hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mauney, this is your Uncle Neville, and this is your
Uncle’s sister, Jane Day. This must be quite an extraordinary
surprise to you, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Mauney nodded.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to stay?” he asked. “When did
you come to this country?”</p>

<p>“We came about a week ago, Mauney. Your Uncle
Neville is over on business, and our headquarters are in
Merlton. We motored all the way from Merlton to-day
just to see where—where you lived, you know.”</p>

<p>“You must be tired. What time did you leave?”</p>

<p>“About seven this morning, but the country has been
simply beautiful, every inch of the way.”</p>

<p>“Come in. Put your car in the shed. I’ll go and
tell my father.”</p>

<p>“Wait!” said his aunt. “Just let’s talk a moment.
You’ve got a brother, but I’ve forgotten his name.”</p>

<p>“William.”</p>

<p>“Of course—how stupid of me to forget! Did you
ever receive a letter I wrote you, Mauney, just after
your mother died?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t remember getting one,” he replied, with
an expression of curiosity.</p>

<p>“That’s strange. Apparently it went astray. But I
always wondered—but then I wrote you again, Mauney,
about three years ago. Didn’t you get that?”</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“Funny!” she said, looking toward her husband.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing funny about trans-Atlantic mails,
my dear,” said Mr. Neville Day, lighting his cigar. “It’s
got well past the funny stage with me.”</p>

<p>“And then I sent you a postcard once, I remember.
Didn’t you even get that, Mauney?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t remember it.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, we’re here,” she said, with sudden
decision. “And if I don’t see him, I’ll always wish I
had.”</p>

<p>“All right, Mary,” said Neville Day. “Now stick to
that, my dear. Would you mind telling your father
there’s somebody here to see him, Mauney?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” Mauney agreed, turning to leave.</p>

<p>“Oh, wait!” called his aunt. “Wait a minute. You
know I—I don’t think I can see him, Neville. No, I
can’t. I really cannot.”</p>

<p>The uncle smoked calmly, studying his finger-nails,
while Mauney stood riddled with curiosity.</p>

<p>“Come here, dear,” said his aunt. “Promise me not
to mention us to your father. We aren’t going in, and
it’s—it’s so hard to explain why we aren’t.”</p>

<p>Neville Day and Miss Jane Day got out of the car
and walked slowly along the edge of the road together.
His aunt asked Mauney to get in the rear seat and sit
beside her. As she turned toward him, he could see his
mother’s likeness with startling vividness.</p>

<p>“Your mother used to write to me about you,
Mauney,” she said. “You were her favorite, I’m glad
you’re such a big fellow. How old are you?”</p>

<p>“Eighteen.”</p>

<p>“It’s terrible how the time goes. I suppose you’re
happy and well all the time—”</p>

<p>He gauged the expression in her eyes. He felt completely
at home with her. She looked so much like his
mother that he wanted to remain with her endlessly.</p>

<p>“Well, Aunt Mary,” he said slowly, “I’m not very
happy, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?” she asked sympathetically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Does your father treat you all right?”</p>

<p>“I think he tries to, Aunt Mary, but since my mother
died, I’ve always been—dissatisfied. How long are you
going to stay—I mean here?”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to return to Lockwood—is that the
name?”</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>“We’ll go back there for the night and return to Merlton,
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Why won’t you come in, and see my father?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Well you see, Mauney, it’s—it’s so late, you know.”</p>

<p>Her explanation was patently false, for he saw her
face struggle to remain composed, and then noticed a
queer hardness come upon it.</p>

<p>“Do you know where the old Conyngham place is?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Sure. Over there!” he pointed to a field not far
away.</p>

<p>“You knew about that, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>He shook his head and glanced with a puzzled expression
toward the old, dilapidated house that had always
stood at the edge of his father’s big corn field.
It was uninhabited and partly obscured by wild cucumber
vines.</p>

<p>“I only knew it was called the old Conyngham place,”
he said. “When mother was alive, she used to go over
there and keep geraniums in boxes in the front windows,
and our hired man—the one we had before—lived there
with his wife for quite a long time.”</p>

<p>“Well, your mother used to live there, Mauney,”
his aunt said, “She was looking after Uncle James.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
You see his wife had died and he was old and sick with
asthma.” She glanced toward the opposite side of the
road. “I suppose this bog-land here gave him the disease.
He was all alone and when we got his letter,
your mother made up her mind to come out and look
after him. So she left Scotland when she was just
seventeen. She remained right with him to the last, and
certainly did not spare herself.”</p>

<p>“My mother never told me that,” Mauney interrupted.</p>

<p>“No. She wouldn’t tell you. But while she was
looking after Uncle James our own mother died in Carstairs
and it was too far for her to come home. Then
I married Neville and, poor girl, she felt that all her
relatives were gone. So, after Uncle James died, she—she
stayed here, you see.”</p>

<p>“Married my father.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mauney,” she said sadly. “Remember, dear
boy, your mother was the sweetest girl that—”</p>

<p>She hesitated, as if her interest in the farm house
and the orchard had suddenly usurped her attention.</p>

<p>“You’ve got quite a big farm, Mauney,” she said.
“Are you going to stay here and be a farmer, too?”</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll have to, Aunt Mary,” he smiled.</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>“But I’d like to get some education, some time.”</p>

<p>Her pretty, blue eyes wandered from his face to the
figures of Neville Day and his sister who were just
turning about to come back toward the car. For a
moment her face became dreamy as if she were mentally
exploring the pleasant future. Then she took a
card from her purse and handed it to him.</p>

<p>“My address is on that, Mauney,” she said. “Please
write to me once in a while and let me know how you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
are getting along. We go back to Scotland in another
week. Dear me, you ought to be glad you live in
America.”</p>

<p>Soon her husband was beside the car.</p>

<p>“That land could all be reclaimed,” he said, wagging
his thumb toward the marsh. “It wouldn’t cost over
two thousand, either.”</p>

<p>“Dollars?” asked Mrs. Day.</p>

<p>“No, pounds.”</p>

<p>“They don’t need to do that sort of thing,” stated
Miss Day. “As it is now, there’s plenty of tillable soil
not under cultivation. I fancy that it will be a long
time before these farmers will find it necessary to reclaim
land.”</p>

<p>Day glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind, Mary,” he said, “it’s getting late
and we’d better try to make Lockwood before dark.
How far is it, Mauney?”</p>

<p>“It’s just over twenty miles.”</p>

<p>They entered the car while Mauney stood on the road
waiting to say good-bye. Neville Day tossed away the
stump of his cigar and settled down behind the wheel,
adjusting his motor-cap more comfortably.</p>

<p>“Oh!” he said, turning to hand up a large parcel, done
up in wrapping paper. “You forgot the books.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Day laughed.</p>

<p>“Mauney,” she said, “I brought you three books, but
I’m not going to give them to you. They are just wild
Indian stories of adventure.”</p>

<p>“Why did you buy that truck, my dear?” asked Day.</p>

<p>“Why, I really didn’t figure it out, Neville,” she
laughed. “I imagined Mauney about fourteen. But I’ll
change them and send them down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Mauney took the proffered hands of Day and his
sister and then his Aunt Mary’s. When his aunt was
kissing him on the cheek, Neville Day was clearing his
throat and chewing at the end of a new cigar. Soon
the motor-car backed into the lane; then, with a sudden
lurch ahead, it snorted up the road, his aunt waving
her hand in farewell. Mauney watched it until it was
engulfed in a dense cloud of dust and the noise of its
opened exhaust had quieted to a faint rumble. Then
he walked slowly up the lane toward the house.</p>

<p>By the kitchen door he encountered his father pumping
himself a tin ladleful of well water.</p>

<p>“Who was them people?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Some tourists.”</p>

<p>“What’d they stop here for?”</p>

<p>“One of the women wanted to pick some blue weed by
the side of the road.”</p>

<p>“H’m! I wish to God she’d pick some of the blue
weed out the grain field,” he said. “Why did they
turn around and go back?”</p>

<p>“They wanted to get to Lockwood before dark, I
guess.”</p>

<p>Later in the evening, Mauney sat on the kitchen verandah
lost in thought. He leaned back in his tilted chair
and rested his head on the window-sill. Presently he
fell asleep. He was awakened by a sharp sensation on
his chin.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he asked, opening his eyes to
see the hired girl standing near him, smiling broadly.</p>

<p>“I just pulled one of them hairs out o’ your chin,
Maun,” she laughed. “When are yuh goin’ to start to
shave ’em?”</p>

<p>The story he had heard from his aunt, with its unexplained
gaps, filled Mauney’s mind for days. He
wondered most about what she had not told him. Her
seemingly instinctive fear—or was it scorn?—of meeting
his father roused torturing curiosity. Probably his
mother’s letters had told her either plainly or in suggestive
language of her great unhappiness.</p>

<p>The motor-car visit haunted him. It was so unnatural,
as though, in a painful dream, he had beheld
his own mother, whose features were to remain before
him in waking hours. Spectre-like out of the unknown
world she had come, to vanish immediately, leaving
scant comfort, herself immune from his ardent desire
to detain her.</p>

<p>The incident was characteristic of life, as he was
learning to know it, for he gained cognizance of an enigmatical
curse aimed at whatever promised happiness.
One whom even a few moments had enshrined in his
affections must tremble and disappear, as a delicate bird,
hovering for an instant, is driven away by a sight or
smell.</p>

<p>Every aspiration of his existence was leashed to his
father’s stolid nature. He traced the deterring thongs,
one by one, back to the paternal influence. Some hidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
action or some unrevealed quality of his father’s had
driven his aunt away in a dust-cloud. And the dust
which rose up to obscure her loved face was symbolic,
for dust of a kind was slowly settling upon the freshness
of his own nature.</p>

<p>One evening his reverie of unhappiness was broken
by a familiar voice when, turning about, he beheld David
McBratney trudging along with a large, grey, telescope
valise. In answer to his question, McBratney replied
that he was starting on foot for Lockwood, where next
morning he would take the train for Merlton to begin
his ministerial studies. He was walking because his
father, suffering from ill-humor, had refused him a
horse. But evidently, there was no martyrdom about
the situation.</p>

<p>“He’s an old man,” Dave said, putting down his burden
and wiping his forehead with a big, red handkerchief,
“and I didn’t like to start no row.”</p>

<p>“Are you going for good?” Mauney asked, rising
from the grass and walking slowly to the edge of the
road.</p>

<p>“Sure. I sold my three-year-old yesterday for a hundred,
and that’ll keep me for a while up to Merlton. I
guess Dad will come around after a while. But I reckon
I’d just blow away, quiet like, without causin’ too much
commotion.”</p>

<p>“You’re a cheerful cuss, Dave,” Mauney said.</p>

<p>“You bet,” he laughed, as he turned to look back toward
his home. “I tell yuh, Maun, when a fellah gets
sort o’ squared away with God Almighty, why, he can’t
be no other way. Some o’ the neighbors says I’m
makin’ a big mistake to leave the farm. But that farm
ain’t nothin’ to me now. Maybe I won’t never have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
bit o’ land to me name, but, I’m tellin’ yuh, I’ve got
somethin’ as more’n makes up. Well, Maun, old boy,”
he said, picking up his valise and sticking out his big,
sun-burned hand. “I’ll be goin’ along. Good-bye. Best
of luck to yuh!”</p>

<p>For minutes Mauney stood thoughtfully watching his
retreating figure as, swinging into a long stride, he covered
the first lap of his long walk to Lockwood. His
big figure grew smaller and smaller and the valise dwindled
to a little grey speck, but he never turned to look
back and soon he was lost in a bend of the road.</p>

<p>Although Mauney disliked in McBratney, what he
considered half-familiar references to the Creator, he
distinctly admired his courage and did not hesitate to
express his admiration next day at supper when the subject
came up. Evidently Bard had called at the McBratney’s
that afternoon on his way from Beulah.</p>

<p>“The old man’s all broke up,” he said. “Poor old
chap. There he is right in the middle of the hayin’ with
nobody to help him, and Dave walks right out an’ leaves
him. He might ’a’ stayed till the first o’ August, anyway.”</p>

<p>“I guess Dave’s got it pretty bad, Dad,” William remarked
as he spread a large chunk of butter over his
bread. “Anybody that’ll start out an’ walk to Lockwood
on a hot night, carrying a big grip, why, there’s somethin’
wrong with his brains. I never figured Dave’d be
such a damned fool!”</p>

<p>Mauney looked up sharply at his brother.</p>

<p>“He isn’t a damned fool!” he said flushing. “I may
not have any more use for religion than you have,
Bill, but I admire any fellow who does what he thinks
is right!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is that so?” scoffed William, glaring across the table.
“Well, now look here, freshie—”</p>

<p>Mauney, inflamed by the word, as well as by his
brother’s sneering manner, jumped to his feet, and became
the centre of attention.</p>

<p>“I refuse to be called ‘freshie’ by you,” he said with
some effort at restraint, “and I have just enough sympathy
with Dave McBratney that I’m not going to have
you call him a damned fool, either!”</p>

<p>Bard pounded the table.</p>

<p>“Here, sit down, Maun,” he commanded and then
turned with a faint smile toward his elder son. “Bill,
eat your victuals and be quiet. O’ course,” he added
presently, “there ain’t no doubt but what Dave is a
damned fool, and he’s goin’ to wake up one o’ these
days and find it out, too. But now he’s gone away I
don’t see what the old man’s goin’ to do. I advised him
to sell out the farm and go up to Beulah an’ take it
easy. There ain’t no good o’ William Henry stayin’
down here no longer. He’ll have to get a hired man
now, and with wages where they is he wouldn’t clean
up nothin’.”</p>

<p>After a short silence, William chuckled softly as he
raised his saucer of hot, clear tea to his lips.</p>

<p>“I was just thinkin’ about the Orange Walk down to
Lockwood last year,” he explained. “There was Dave,
with a few drinks in him, struttin’ around the park,
darin’ everybody to a scrap. Gosh, it’s funny to think
o’ him bein’ a preacher. I mind that night—we didn’t
get home till seven o’clock the next mornin’ an’ I pitched
in the harvest field all that day.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” nodded Bard. “I’ve done the same thing many
a time when I was your age.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“And the next night,” continued William proudly,
“me and Dave was up to Ras Livermore’s harvest dance.
That hoe-down lasted till five in the mornin’. I can see
Dave yet, sweatin’ through the whole thing—never
missed a dance.”</p>

<p>“Wonder if Ras is goin’ to put on a shin-dig this
here harvest?” mused Bard.</p>

<p>“He ain’t never missed puttin’ one on since I can
remember,” said the hired girl, who had been listening
intently.</p>

<p>“The other day,” William remarked, “I saw Ras up
in Abe Lavanagh’s barber shop. I ast him if he was
goin’ to have a dance this year an’ he hit me an awful
clout on the back an’ he says: ‘Better’n’ bigger’n ever,
my boy. Come an’ bring yer fleusie. They’ll be plenty
to eat, and Alec Dent is goin’ to fiddle again.’”</p>

<p>“And I guess Dave won’t hear the music, neither,”
said Bard.</p>

<p class="tb">About ten days after his aunt’s visit Mauney received
a letter from her, written in Merlton, and containing a
crisp, five-dollar bill. “I really haven’t had time to
choose a gift for you,” she wrote, “so please buy any
little thing you fancy. Your Uncle Neville and I are
leaving for New York to-night, and intend sailing the
next day for Scotland. Neville is afraid England will
be drawn into this terrible European mix-up, and of
course, if that happens, he may have to leave his business
as he holds a majority in the Scottish Borderers. I’m
praying there won’t be a war, but it certainly does look
dark.”</p>

<p>War! Mauney located the <cite>Beulah Weekly</cite> in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
wood-box and searched its columns in vain for any mention
of European politics. He wished that his father
had consented to have a rural telephone installed, so
that he could telephone now to some of the neighbors
and find out what was transpiring. Next day in Beulah
he asked the postmaster through the wicket if there
seemed to be any danger of a war.</p>

<p>“War!” the man repeated, staring stupidly through
his high-refractive spectacles. “Whereabouts?”</p>

<p>“In Europe.”</p>

<p>The postmaster reflectively poked his index finger
into his mouth to free his molar teeth from remnants
of his recent supper.</p>

<p>“I guess not,” he said lazily. “I ain’t heard nothin’
about it.”</p>

<p>“Do you know a good Merlton newspaper?” Mauney
enquired.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” he replied, his face at once brightening to
a patronizing smile. “The <cite>Merlton Globe</cite> is the best. It
is the newsiest paper printed in the country, unexcelled
for its editorials, has the largest unsolicited circulation,
is unequalled for its want ad. columns, and reflects
daily the current thought and events of both hemispheres.
Yuh’d certainly get what yer huntin’ for in the
<cite>Merlton Globe</cite>, Mr. Bard, ’cause if there’s any war on
anywhere—don’t matter where—they’d most likely have
it.”</p>

<p>“What does it cost?” Mauney asked.</p>

<p>“Only five dollars per year,” he replied politely, removing
an eye-shade from his forehead, and staring
anxiously at his customer. “Of course, I’m the local
agent, you know,” he added.</p>

<p>“Oh! are you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes—yes,” he said, with a nervous little laugh,
his hands together as if in the act of ablution.</p>

<p>For a moment Mauney hesitated, while his hand,
deep in his pocket, felt the crisp treasury note with
which he was so tempted to part. A number of considerations
caused him to weigh well his present transaction,
but he soon gave his initials to the eager postmaster
and went home satisfied.</p>

<p>Seth Bard had, of course, always been able to find
sufficient news in the <cite>Beulah Weekly</cite>. It is doubtful if
he would have spent the annual dollar on it except for
the long column advertising farm sales. He usually
spent half an hour searching this portion of the paper,
then a listless five minutes over the personal column,
which, to his particular mind, provided an amusing satire,
only to fall asleep, later, as he tried to read the fragmentary
generalities that filled the stereotyped section.
The hired girl religiously preserved the editions until
she had found time to read the instalments of a continued
love story. When the <cite>Merlton Globe</cite> began to
arrive with the name of “Mr. Mauney Bard” upon it, a
precedent seemed to have been established for introducing
unwelcome new factors into the self-sufficient household.</p>

<p>“Where’d you get the money?” Bard demanded, in
accordance with Mauney’s expectations.</p>

<p>“Found it,” he replied, just as he had planned to do.</p>

<p>There was no more questioning, although Mauney
knew his father did not believe him. With queer pride,
Bard scorned to read the big daily, although the woman
found back numbers useful for lining pantry shelves.</p>

<p>“We don’t worry none about what’s goin’ on over in
Europe, Bill,” remarked the father one evening while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Mauney sat nearby reading the paper. “If they want to
put on a war over there, why, let ’em sail to it. ’Taint
none o’ our business.”</p>

<p>“Guess we got ’bout enough to do, running this here
farm, Dad,” William agreed, “without wastin’ any time
with that kind o’ truck.”</p>

<p class="tb">The annual harvest dance at Ras Livermore’s was a
long-standing event of great local interest, for, since
most people could remember, it had been as faithful in
its appearance as the harvest itself. Men of fifty recalled
gala nights spent there in their exuberant twenties.
Livermore was benevolent and kindly, well over
seventy, and had developed hospitality to a degree where
he required it now as a social tonic. No invitations
were sent out because rumour of the event invariably
preceded the event itself, thus fixing the date, and, as
to the personnel of the guests, Livermore’s slogan of
“Everybody come” was sufficient, for he knew that the
ultra-religious of Beulah would never appear and that
the best recommendation for the qualities of a guest
was the very spontaneity that impelled him or her to be
present.</p>

<p>For the past three years it had been one of the bright
spots in Mauney’s life and so, on the day of the dance,
he brought downstairs his best suit of clothes for the
hired girl to sponge and press. The men did not get
in from the grain field until seven o’clock.</p>

<p>“Me and Annie’ll manage the milkin’ to-night,” Bard
generously announced, as they ate supper. “Snowball’s
goin’ too. Soon’s yuh get through eatin’, Maun, go bed
the horses, and, Bill, you an’ Snowball pump the cows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
some water an’ draw the binder under the machine shed.
Then hitch up old Charlie, jump into yer boiled shirts,
and get up to Ras’s.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t you goin’, Dad?” William asked.</p>

<p>“No. I’m goin’ over to see William Henry an’ make
him an offer on his farm. Annie’ll have to stay here an’
look after the house. I’m gettin’ too old fer this here
dancin’ business anyway. I used to be able to stay
with the best of ’em, Bill, but a plug o’ chewing tobacco
is about as much dissipation as I can stand now.”</p>

<p>By nine o’clock Mauney, with his brother and Snowball,
were driving up through Beulah and turning at the
end of the village along the Stone Road. Three miles
through the darkening landscape brought them nearer a
cluster of pine trees behind which Livermore’s large
frame house could be seen with every window alight.
Between the trees were suspended yellow Japanese lanterns
in long, bellying rows, beneath which could be
seen the moving white gowns of women and the dark
forms of men standing in groups. Buggy-loads of
people were constantly arriving and being directed by
Livermore who, dressed in an old-fashioned cut-away
suit, was strutting about as actively as a man of thirty.
A congestion of buggies at the lane entrance required
William to pull up the horse, and wait his turn.</p>

<p>“Hello, Ras!” came the shout of greeting from one
of the buggies. “How’s yer old heart?”</p>

<p>“She’s still a-pumpin’!” he replied, causing a general
outburst of laughter, since Livermore was noted for an
individualistic strain of wit, and anything he might say
was to be thus rewarded.</p>

<p>“Hello, is that you, Bill?” he called as they passed
him. “I see yer girl is here before you. Drive right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
in. There’s more people here to-night than yuh’d see
at yer own funeral. Hurry up, Bill, ’cause there’s a
mighty sight o’ fine women-folks here, and not a Methodist
foot among ’em.”</p>

<p>Even a half-hour later, as Mauney strolled about the
lawn chatting with acquaintances, load after load of
laughing people continued to arrive, and he joined the
crowd who were lined up watching Livermore greet his
guests.</p>

<p>“Drive right into the yard, boys,” he called. “If they
hain’t room under the cow-sheds, hitch ’em up to the
wind-mill.”</p>

<p>“Quite a turn-out, Ras,” remarked Doctor Horne, as
he suddenly reined his black horse into the lane.</p>

<p>“Hello, Doc! Well, well, well, if here ain’t Doc
Horne!” exclaimed Livermore, advancing to shake the
physician’s hand. “I tell yuh, doc, it’s a pretty frisky
lot o’ people. You kin tie your horse to the fence, case
you git a call an’ have to leave early. One o’ the boys’ll
show you.”</p>

<p>“Is that scoundrel, Alec Dent, here to-night?” asked
Horne in a mock-whisper, leaning over the side of his
buggy.</p>

<p>“Yes, an’ dancin’ is goin’ to start directly, Doc. Alec
has just had a pint o’ rye whiskey an’ there ain’t enough
furniture left on the kitchen floor fer an Esquimo to
start house-keepin’ with.”</p>

<p>“Whoop!” laughed Horne in a loud chuckle, as he
touched his horse with the whip. “Erastus, you old reprobate,
you old skunk!”</p>

<p>Women were busy preparing five long tables under
the pine trees for the refreshments which would be
served at midnight. Mauney was inveigled into carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
benches by Myrtle McGee, one of the acknowledged
belles of the countryside, who came up to him in her
usual direct way, carrying a pile of plates, and smiling
seductively.</p>

<p>“D’yuh want to work?” she enquired, with a much
more intimate address than the occasion demanded.</p>

<p>“That’s what I came up here to avoid,” Mauney
laughed as he looked down into her sharp, black eyes.</p>

<p>“But you’d help me, wouldn’t you?” she pouted. “Go
fetch some o’ them benches, like a good boy.”</p>

<p>After he had obeyed, and while the crowd of people
were slowly moving back toward the kitchen, drawn by
the lure of the violin music, she came up with him
again, fanning her flushed face with her handkerchief.
She was not more than twenty and wore a pleated,
white silk gown that gave attractive exposure of her
arms and bosom, smooth and firm like yellowed ivory,
and contrasted markedly with her jet-black hair, decorated
by a comb of brilliants.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, tilting her head sidewise, and according
him an angled glance, “I s’pose you’re goin’
to give me yer first dance, ain’t yuh, Maun?”</p>

<p>A subtle compliment was conveyed in this unconventional
invitation, and Mauney, surprised at his own susceptibility,
at once agreed. Together they strolled toward
the kitchen verandah where already a crowd was
assembled. The windows and doors of the kitchen were
all removed, and Mauney, peering above the mass of
eager heads, saw a broad strip of yellow floor, reflecting
the light of several oil-lamps set in wall brackets.
As yet no dancing had begun, but Alexander Dent, a
corpulent man of sixty with a heavy, pasty face, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
perched on top of the kitchen stove, where, seated on
a chair, his body swung to the rhythm of his bow.</p>

<p>“Jest gettin’ warmed up!” he announced, with a sly
glance from the corner of his black eyes toward the
crowd at the doors.</p>

<p>This was the twenty-eighth annual harvest dance at
which he had assumed responsibility for the music. In
accordance with his ideal of never growing old he had
undertaken, in late years, to dye his hair and moustache
much blacker than they had ever been even in his youth.
Only his chin, which receded weakly beneath his bushy
moustache, gave any evidence of age, for his quick
eyes, his animated movements, the tap-tap of his toe
keeping time against the stove lid, suggested youth. He
was to be accompanied by an organ set at the top of
three steps leading to the dining room, at which Mrs.
Livermore, second wife of the host, already presided in
readiness. As Dent finished his first flourish and began
tucking a large, white silk handkerchief under his chin
Erastus Livermore appeared on the floor and initiated
applause in which every one joined. In a moment the
host raised his hand for order.</p>

<p>He was a big man, slightly bent at the shoulders,
with a high, sloping forehead, a bald pate, a grey, tobacco-stained
moustache and dim, grey eyes, full of quiet
hospitality that sparkled brightly as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Folks,” he said, by way of opening the function, “I
dunno why I allus have to get out here an’ say a few
words. The woman told me I had to do it, so I guess
that’s reason enough.”</p>

<p>A burst of laughter followed this remark.</p>

<p>“When I look around and see you folks all dressed up
in yer Sunday-go-to-meetin’ clothes, makes me think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
how much the styles is changed since the first dance we
put on here. In them days, the women folks all had
big hoop skirts, that ud hardly go through that there
door. But now we see a change. They believe more in
advertisin’ and showin’ off their ankles.”</p>

<p>“Ras—Ras!” came Mrs. Livermore’s disapproving
voice.</p>

<p>Again the guests laughed, this time more heartily.</p>

<p>“Well—ain’t it true, folks?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Sure, Ras!”</p>

<p>“You bet.”</p>

<p>Just then the rural telephone, which was attached to
the kitchen wall, rang five short rings.</p>

<p>“That’s our call,” Livermore said to his wife. “Tell
’em to come a jumpin’, we hain’t even started yet.”</p>

<p>When she had answered the telephone she whispered
something to her husband.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said. “I’m sorry to have to call our old
friend, Doctor Horne. He’s wanted at onct down the
Graham road, at Bob Lombard’s. I guess maybe the
baby has swallowed a carpet tack.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Ras,” came Horne’s voice from outside.
“Don’t let me interrupt your speech!”</p>

<p>“Come back if you can, Doc!”</p>

<p>“I think by the way you and Alexander Dent are starting
in, you may need me before you get through,” replied
Horne, already untying his horse from the fence nearby.
When the laughter had again subsided, Livermore continued.</p>

<p>“An’ there’s only two o’ that old brigade left here to-night,”
he said, “myself and Alec Dent.”</p>

<p>The musician’s name was greeted by a loud hand-clapping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
to which he responded by rising from his chair
and executing a deep salaam.</p>

<p>“Mind the lids, Alec,” continued Livermore. “I bet
Alec ain’t forgot them hoop skirts.”</p>

<p>“Why, no,” affirmed the musician in a clear, bass
voice, as he seated himself. “Them was the fantastic
days, Rastus. It was right on this floor I met the
woman that’s been bossin’ me around ever since. Them
was <em>the</em> days!”</p>

<p>“Now, folks,” said the host, “With these few openin’
words, I’ll call on our old friend to play a cotillion, an’
I want everybody to light right in an’ hoe ’er down till
mornin’! Joe Hanson, the man on the right with the
false teeth, is goin’ to call off, a-standin’ on the wood-box,
an’ I want to see the young folks get well het up.
Ready, Alec?”</p>

<p>The butt of his bow was poised over the strings of
his violin, his head nestled down to the instrument, his
toe lifted preparatory to the opening note. He nodded.</p>

<p>“Then let her go!”</p>

<p>The thrilling call of the violin immediately drew four
sets to occupy their places on the kitchen floor—tall, sun-burned
youths with coats cast aside, smiling at their
partners who quivered with eagerness to be started.
Mauney and Miss McGee were unable to gain entrance,
but collided with Amos Blancher, a husky fellow to
whom she had evidently promised the first dance. He
demanded an explanation.</p>

<p>“Why, Ame,” she said, “you’re too slow to catch a
cold. Mauney an’ I are goin’ to have the first dance
together, ain’t we, Maun?”</p>

<p>Blancher scowled ill-temperedly at Mauney and
backed away, muttering under his breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s goin’ to be a corkin’ good set, too,” predicted
Miss McGee, leaning against Mauney’s arm as they
watched the progress of the dance.</p>

<p>“Address your partner; corners the same,” commanded
Hanson from his position on the wood-box.</p>

<p>Everyone bowed, and immediately scuffled their feet
in rhythm with the music.</p>

<p>Another bow, in a different figure, and again the
prancing of eager feet.</p>

<p>“Right and left through and inside couple swing.
Right and left back and the same old thing!”</p>

<p>Hanson entered into the spirit so thoroughly that his
voice took on a barbarous rhythm, but he enunciated
his directions very clearly considering the fact that his
upper plate habitually fell away from the roof of his
mouth on open syllables.</p>

<p>“Ladies turn out, with the bull in the ring; gents
come out and give birdie a swing!”</p>

<p>The process of giving “birdie” a swing included a
vigorous masculine lurch which brought the lady from
the floor with much sailing of her skirts and exposure
of her muscular, black-stockinged calves.</p>

<p>“Lady round lady and gents go slow; lady round
gent and gents don’t go.”</p>

<p>Thus continued the strenuous dance, while the faces
of the dancers began to flush with the warmth of their
exercise, and the fiddler proceeded exuberantly and with
growing animation from one movement to the next.
When the first set was finished, another, made up of different
dancers, commenced, leaving only time for Alexander
Dent to reach for a proffered glass of spirits. By
an unwritten law it was understood that whiskey was
reserved only for the fiddler as an indulgent acknowledgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of his services, but the stealthy movement of
the occasional youth to the back box of his buggy in the
yard was forgiven if he exercised moderation.</p>

<p>Those not engaged in dancing played euchre in the
dining room or sat on long benches on the verandah
telling stories, exchanging gossip or discussing crops.
By midnight, Mauney, weary of the music, and weary,
too, of the monotonous jargon of his associates, stole a
few moments by himself on the end of the front verandah
farthest from the rest.</p>

<p>The great orb of the red, harvest moon was rising
like a ball of molten, quivering fire from the deep purple
scarf of smoky air that lay upon the horizon, while a
warm breeze moved from the stubble field nearby. His
thoughts drifted fancifully, trying to free themselves
from the weird thralldom of the dance, imagining the
moon the secret source of heat that supplied the dancers
with energy, and the warm breeze an emanation from
their impassioned enthusiasm. Past him, as he sat
secluded behind a vine of Virginia creeper, a youth and
a maiden, unsuspecting his presence, walked quietly side
by side until they stood by the cedar edge at the border
of the grove. He watched the moonlight reflected from
the maiden’s face as she glanced quickly toward the
house, and from her arms as they encircled her lover’s
neck. The lover bent toward her and pressed his lips
passionately upon her mouth. Then they returned, with
a new rhythm in their gait, to join the crowd who sat
at the other side of the house.</p>

<p>Mauney breathed with mild difficulty as if stifled by
the glamor of the sultry night. Then in a mood of inexplicable
detachment he wandered again through the
groups of people, half unconscious of their presence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
He stood watching the dancers once more and listening
to the endless grind of the fiddle. A round dance was
in progress and his eyes followed the two lovers now
clasped in the dreamy movement of a waltz. He could
not understand why the picture blurred as he watched
it. He was thinking of the beauty of love—the tragedy
of love—this closed, complete, unopening circle of passion
that drifted to the beat of the music heedless of the
universe. His eyes wandered from their graceful forms
to dwell upon the yellow glow of the Japanese lanterns.</p>

<p>A stronger breeze came from the fields and moved
the big lanterns till one of them caught fire and burned,
attracting the attention of a score of people.</p>

<p>Then there were five, sudden, sharp rings!</p>

<p>The music ceased. The dancers paused. Livermore
entered from the verandah, and going to the telephone
put the receiver to his ear. Casual curiosity prompted
a general quietness among the guests.</p>

<p>“Hello! Yes, this is Ras, speakin’. Who’s that?
Hello, Frank, why ain’t you up to the dance? What?”</p>

<p>Turning about, Livermore waved to the guests. “Be
quiet jest a minute. It’s kind o’ hard to hear him.”</p>

<p>For a moment he listened, while the changing expression
on his face provoked greater curiosity and greater
quietness.</p>

<p>“Ain’t that a caution?” he exclaimed, hanging up the
receiver. “If England hain’t gone and declared war on
Germany.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked a voice on the verandah.</p>

<p>“War—the British is gone to war,” Livermore
answered. “Frank Davidson just got back from Lockwood,
an’ says the news just reached Lockwood afore
he left.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>“War, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yep! So Frank says. Maybe it’s just talk.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess it ain’t goin’ to do us no harm, Ras,
anyhow,” said Alec Dent, waving with his fiddle-stick.
“Get off the floor an’ give ’em a chance, Ras.”</p>

<p>Again the slow, measured music of the waltz floated
out on the night air, and Mauney watched the lovers
continue in their embrace.</p>

<p>His heart pounded with excitement. Vague sympathies,
eager yearnings, and impatient impulses moved
by turns in his breast. That which the newspapers had
suspected had become fact. How could these people
continue to dance in the face of such catastrophic news?
He could not dance. He could only think and think,
and wonder why, in the unexplorable depths of his
heart, he was glad that war was come.</p>

<p>Four weeks of the European fury had become history,
but as yet the district around Beulah preserved its
accustomed indifference to outside influences. In staid
self-sufficiency farmers garnered their harvest, for, if
the war ever entered their heads, it was soon dismissed
as a far-away happening which could never have relation
to themselves. Great Britain had conducted campaigns
before, when, as now, a veteran here or there
might heed the alarm and be off to his favorite sport,
but it was never dreamed that the inviolate aloofness
of Lantern Marsh, for instance, could ever be affected.</p>

<p>Farm lands continued, as usual, to be bought and sold.
Bard, after much careful barter, procured the valuable
estate of William Henry McBratney for a sum which
he might have been ashamed to confess, save for personal
vanity over his own close bargaining. The purchase,
however, ended in a disappointment, for, on offering
it to his elder son as a proposed wedding endowment,
he discovered that William was averse to marrying,
and the newly acquired property had therefore to
lie idle. Hired help was not to be had, since already the
excitement of war was drawing floaters to the cities
and Bard had to content himself with the thought that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the war would soon be ended and that William might
by then have discovered a woman whom he would be
willing to marry.</p>

<p>Mauney found in the war the first successful antidote
to his long existing boredom, for, except when he was
working, he was reading the <cite>Merlton Globe</cite> and following
events with keenest interest. One day at noon, a
large, green motor-car drove suddenly up the lane, and
two uniformed officers enquired of Bard if he had any
horses to sell. It was to be an army purchase, and
Bard, after sending them away empty, bethought himself
seriously, with an air of brewing plans.</p>

<p>“Bill,” he said, “if this here war goes on, I’d like to
own a few horses. But then,” he added, “’tain’t goin’
to last!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mauney had heard that men were enlisting
in Lockwood. Like a flash, he imagined the possibilities
of offering himself as a recruit. It was the first
time that he had connected the war in any way with himself,
and it was mostly his long-cherished craving to
leave home that made him do so. The first real breath
of the actual war entered the Bard household one evening
at supper when Mauney said to his father:</p>

<p>“Dad, I’d love to go to war!”</p>

<p>Bard was rendered speechless; William smiled sarcastically
at his father, and then all, including hired help,
stopped eating and stared at Mauney.</p>

<p>“You!” gasped Bard. “Well, what put that in your
head?”</p>

<p>William laughed quietly.</p>

<p>“I guess they’d never take him, Dad,” he said.</p>

<p>“What do you know about soldierin’?” Bard demanded.
“Why, you’d be a nice-lookin’ outfit. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
look here,” he said in a tone of ominous finality; “you
can just get that idea out o’ your head, right away, understand
me. You ain’t goin’ to no war, and the sooner
you realize it the better for you.”</p>

<p>That night, however, Mauney did not sleep. The
germ of unrest had been inoculated into his blood. His
glimpse of a solution for his troubles had turned his
mind so irrevocably toward the new purpose that he
did not even undress, but lay wakeful and undecided.
He knew his father’s present attitude well enough, but
he did not know what his attitude would be in case he
were defied.</p>

<p>When the first breezes of morning moved the cotton
curtains of his window, showing grey in the dawning
light, Mauney got up and sat by the window, gazing at
the indistinct outlines of trees, listening to the stirring
birds and the distant call of a rooster. He felt
that he was listening to these particular sounds for the
last time. As it grew lighter he tip-toed to the attic
for an old leather valise, brought it to his room, and
packed up his few belongings. Then, when he heard
movement in the kitchen, he went down. The woman,
busy at the stove, turned and looked at his valise.</p>

<p>“Where are you goin’, Maun?” she asked, a little dubiously.</p>

<p>“To Lockwood.”</p>

<p>“What for?” she continued, searching his face.</p>

<p>“To enlist.”</p>

<p>She made no reply, but applied herself quietly to her
task of preparing breakfast. When Bard came in he
saw Mauney sitting on the step that led to the dining-room
with his valise on the floor beside him.</p>

<p>“What are you doin’ with your Sunday clothes on?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
he asked, while his narrow eyes fell to notice the valise.
“Where are yuh goin’?”</p>

<p>“Lockwood.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“To enlist.”</p>

<p>Bard stamped across the floor to the wash basin and
began vigorously washing his hands. Only the unnecessary
splashing of water and the rattling of the basin
expressed his mental condition. When he finished he
walked to his place at the table and sat down.</p>

<p>“Annie,” he said very softly, “give me them eggs.”</p>

<p>The woman obeyed with great punctiliousness as if
dreading the storm of language soon to escape the paternal
lips. Bard ate in silence, never once looking up.
Then, pushing his plate from him, he loaded his pipe,
lit it, and for the first time glanced at Mauney.</p>

<p>“When are you goin’?” he asked, as casually as if it
were to Beulah for the evening mail.</p>

<p>“This morning,” said Mauney.</p>

<p>“How are you going to get there?” Bard continued,
in ominous calmness.</p>

<p>“I thought perhaps Snowball would drive me down,”
said Mauney, uncertain at what instant to expect a volcano
of abuse.</p>

<p>For a moment or two Bard stood thoughtfully by the
window, evidently weighing the situation.</p>

<p>“Well, Maun, I tell yuh,” he said at length. “There
ain’t no chanct in the world of ’em takin’ a kid like
you. But I guess maybe the best way to cure you is to
let you go down and get it over with. When you get
down there and see the hull outfit lined up you’ll change
yer mind, anyhow. Tell yuh what I’ll do. I’ll let
Snowball and you off fer the day. Snowball’s gettin’ kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
o’ stale on the job, too, and maybe a drive to Lockwood
would sort o’ brace him up. But, mind, I don’t want to
hear no more damned nonsense after you get home, understand
me.”</p>

<p>At noon that day old Charlie, covered with lather
from the twenty-mile journey, drew Mauney and the
hired man into the town of Lockwood. Mauney sat
leaning back, absent-mindedly watching the road, while
Snowball held the reins and occasionally touched the
horse’s flanks with the whip.</p>

<p>A great weight had fallen from Mauney’s shoulders
the moment they had passed out of his father’s farmyard
and, during the drive in the sultry morning air,
his imagination had moved quickly. He felt the great
doors of the world opening to receive him. He felt
that he was proceeding now into the mystery of real
life long denied him. The war was truly a secondary
consideration. He knew nothing about the practical
side of campaigning. Dimly, though, he fancied that
once he reached the Lockwood armouries, some one
there would take him admiringly by the hand with expressions
of welcome and commendation for his noble
decision.</p>

<p>When they had passed along King Street they came to
the wide green upon whose upper portion reposed the
grey stone armouries with its mullioned windows, its
turrets, its scalloped parapets, and its tall flag-pole bearing
a huge flag that floated lazily in the breeze. A
dozen men in ordinary clothes stood in several groups
near the huge doorway, while an occasional soldier in
uniform walked stiffly across the lawn to disappear beneath
the arch. After noting that his suitcase was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
safely bestowed in the bottom of the buggy, Mauney got
out and adjusted his tie and soft hat.</p>

<p>“Snowball,” he said, “you stay here till I come back.
I’m going to see if this is where to enlist.”</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll g-go in with you, Maun!” stammered
the hired man as he got out and began tying the horse
to a pavement ring. “I hain’t never worried much
about soldierin’, but may’s well see the doin’s now as
I’m here. Wait a minute, Maun.”</p>

<p>Together they walked across the green and soon
came up with a group of civilians who were talking
about the war. One of them was a veteran of several
campaigns, for he wore a line of medals pinned to his
vest and kept his coat well pulled back to display them.
He pointed Mauney to the doorway.</p>

<p>As they were about to enter, an erect individual, neatly
uniformed, with waxed moustache and a short, black
stick held under one Of his straight arms, advanced to
meet them.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” he demanded, crisply.</p>

<p>“I want to enlist,” Mauney explained.</p>

<p>“Recruits?” he snapped haughtily, and pointed with
his finger. “To the right, fall in line behind the others
and wait your turn.”</p>

<p>Mauney thanked him and turned to the hired man.</p>

<p>“You better wait for me outside, Snowball!” he said.</p>

<p>The crisp individual in uniform glanced quickly at
Snowball, his eyes keenly studying him.</p>

<p>“You may wait here,” he said, “if you choose.”</p>

<p>The interior of the armouries was so dark that until
Mauney’s eyes became accustomed to the dimness, he
paused, unable to see the queue of civilians who were
standing in line in front of a frosted-glass door. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
then made his way over the flag-stones and took up his
position in the rear. From a skylight in the high roof
a beam of light fell through the dusty air of the big
room and, striking in a huge square pattern on the
centre of the floor, revealed two teams of horses dragging
a field-gun down the middle of the drill-space. The
rattle and din, increased by the shouted commands of
some visible officers, were so deafening that Mauney
did not notice the frosted-glass door open to receive six
of his companions. He moved up and patiently waited
his turn. At last his time came and he entered with
five of his fellow recruits.</p>

<p>In the meantime Snowball sat on the edge of a green
box at the entrance, smoking his pipe. The sergeant
who had so leniently granted him permission to remain
was at a short distance, tête-a-tête with a second sergeant
who wore a dangle of white, red and green ribbons
from the peak of his cap. The first sergeant
pointed toward Snowball, made a gesture with his hands,
at which the other nodded, and advanced toward the
unsuspecting servant.</p>

<p>“Hello, my man,” said the sergeant, slapping Snowball
genially on the back. “How old are you?”</p>

<p>“Forty-five or six,” he replied, looking up curiously.</p>

<p>“Stand up, won’t you?”</p>

<p>Snowball obeyed, rather dubiously.</p>

<p>“My word!” remarked the sergeant, feigning to be
overcome with admiring surprise. “You’re a splendid
specimen. Where did you get that chest?”</p>

<p>“I g-guess hard work done that,” he said, commencing
to giggle.</p>

<p>“You’re just the kind of a man we’re looking for,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
sir,” said the sergeant, placing one hand on Snowball’s
bosom and the other on his back. “Take a long breath.”</p>

<p>He inspired deeply, casting a sharp, doubtful glance
at the sergeant.</p>

<p>“I say, but you’re well put together, sir,” remarked
the latter. “You’d make a fine soldier, I reckon.”</p>

<p>For an instant Snowball’s tilted face turned hesitatingly
toward his flatterer. Then he began once more
to laugh.</p>

<p>“You can’t fool me, so you can’t,” he said, sitting
down and avoiding the sergeant’s eyes.</p>

<p>“But I’m not trying to fool you, sir,” he averted.
“You’d be an A1 man, I swear.”</p>

<p>Snowball shuffled his feet, and drew vigorously on
his pipe.</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t take me, so they wouldn’t,” he said
seriously with a jerk of his head toward the doorway.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the sergeant, “would you go, if they
found you fit?”</p>

<p>“Hain’t no use t-talking about it,” Snowball responded
in a melancholy tone. “So they hain’t!”</p>

<p>“Try them, sir, try them—won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Come with me, sir,” he added, taking Snowball’s arm,
when much to his surprise, the latter rose and accompanied
him.</p>

<p>Mauney passed his physical examination and was
led into a second room. He noticed that none of the
others had been taken there. Behind a desk sat a young,
clear-faced man with bone-rimmed spectacles, engaged
in looking through a pile of documents.</p>

<p>“Doctor Poynton,” said the sergeant, who brought
him in, “would you report on this recruit’s vision. The
M.O. just sent him in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right,” nodded the doctor, as the sergeant went
out.</p>

<p>For fully five minutes Mauney stood motionless, waiting
for the eye-examination to commence, while the doctor
continued reading the documents before him and idly
smoking a cigar. When his impatience had nearly gotten
the better of him and he felt tempted to remind the
medical man of his presence, the latter turned in his
chair and placed a stool on the floor a few feet from
his desk.</p>

<p>“Sit down there!” he said in a distant tone, without
looking at Mauney, who obeyed and awaited further instructions.</p>

<p>Doctor Poynton threw away the butt of his cigar
and, opening a drawer, selected another from a box.
This he lighted and blew out the match, meanwhile continuing
uninterruptedly in his reading of the documents.</p>

<p>Mauney, greatly elated at the success of his physical
examination, found his present occupation of waiting
greatly to his dislike. Why should they examine his
eyes? He had never had any trouble with them. He
controlled his impatience, however, as best he could, until,
after many minutes, the doctor looked up.</p>

<p>“Now, then,” he said. “Look at that card on the
wall over yonder. Can you see the letters?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Very well, read them. First letter?”</p>

<p>“E.”</p>

<p>“Next line!”</p>

<p>Mauney read four lines and paused.</p>

<p>“You can’t read the fifth line?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not.”</p>

<p>From a drawer, the doctor produced a testing frame,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
perched it on Mauney’s nose, and slipped two lenses
before his eyes.</p>

<p>“Can you read it now?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, it’s worse than ever.”</p>

<p>He removed the lenses and put in two others.</p>

<p>“Now.”</p>

<p>Mauney read it accurately.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Poynton, removing the frame, and
scribbling some hieroglyphics on a slip of paper.
“That’s all I want. Take this chit in to Captain Blackburn.”</p>

<p>“Where’s he?”</p>

<p>“He’s the officer who examined you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Mauney, returning to the room
from which he had come. There were still half a dozen
recruits stripped, undergoing examination. He waited
until Captain Blackburn should be disengaged.</p>

<p>“Ever had rheumatism?” Blackburn was asking one
of the candidates, while he percussed his chest.</p>

<p>“No,” said a voice which seemed very familiar to
Mauney.</p>

<p>“Cough! All right! Now turn around.”</p>

<p>As the recruit turned, Mauney was astonished to behold
the sun-burned face of Snowball. He would have
exclaimed aloud, but already he felt the humility of a
private soldier restraining him in an officer’s presence.</p>

<p>Blackburn, after applying the bell of his stethoscope
to various areas on Snowball’s back, snapped the instrument
from his ears.</p>

<p>“That’s all—go along—pass him fit, sergeant! Next!”</p>

<p>Snowball scrambled into his clothes and walked
quickly towards Mauney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake, Snowball, did you enlist?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“Shake on it.”</p>

<p>Mauney grasped the hired man’s hand and gave it a
powerful shaking. “You’re a brick, Snowball. Just
wait outside for me, I got through too, but there’s some
red-tape about my eyes.”</p>

<p>When the recruits were all examined and were dressing,
Capt. Blackburn pointed at Mauney.</p>

<p>“Get your eyes tested, boy?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Bring me the report.”</p>

<p>Sticking on a pair of spectacles Blackburn glanced
over the slip of paper.</p>

<p>“Too bad,” he said. “You’re unfit. Sergeant, mark
off M. Bard as unfit for service.”</p>

<p>“But I’m all right,” expostulated Mauney.</p>

<p>“No you’re not, boy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am.”</p>

<p>Blackburn stiffened up.</p>

<p>“Do you realize to whom you’re talking?” he snapped.</p>

<p>A sergeant walked quickly forward and tapped
Mauney’s knuckles with his stick.</p>

<p>“Hands down at your side!” he barked. “You’re
speaking to an officer. Address him as ‘sir!’”</p>

<p>Blackburn tossed the eye-report on the top of his
desk, leisurely removed his spectacles, and then calmly
nodded at the sergeant who was standing stiffly nearby.</p>

<p>“That’s all, sergeant!” he said, indifferently, with a
slight nod toward Mauney.</p>

<p>“Very good, sir,” bawled the sergeant, clicking his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
metal-plated heels together and saluting. Then, seizing
Mauney by the arm, he led him toward the door.</p>

<p>“You can’t join—may as well go home,” he said,
opening the door.</p>

<p>“But I never had any trouble with my eyes,” Mauney
argued, as the sergeant shoved him out into the big
room of the Armouries.</p>

<p>“Don’t matter. You’re unfit!”</p>

<p>Bang! The door closed in his face.</p>

<p>“Good is a man’s death which destroys the evils
of life.”—<cite>Publilius Synus.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Bard delayed two years before he began horse-breeding
in earnest. By that time the war had become a
fixture, with more promise of an endless continuance than
an early peace, and as it was impossible to hire help
for farm work, he grew weary of carrying on his arduous
agricultural labor with only his two sons to assist
him. Consequently he determined to put less soil under
seed and to confine his attentions to horses, since the
army would afford an apparently inexhaustible market
for their purchase. The news of his new determination
was received with gladness by William, who had begun
to tire of his strenuous labors, and with indifference
by Mauney, who, since his rejection at Lockwood, had
remained at home, mechanically submitting to his fate,
and caring little what turn events might take.</p>

<p>A month previously the casualty lists had contained
the name of Snowball, who had been killed in action in
France.</p>

<p>“Don’t seem natural,” Bard had admitted simply,
“Poor old Snowball. If he hadn’t been such a fool he’d
be right here to-day, same as the rest of us.”</p>

<p>But Mauney questioned whether the fate of their
former servant was not indeed preferable to his own.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
In quiet moments—too quiet and too numerous for his
liking—he secretly envied Snowball, for it seemed that
a few months of death-rewarded struggle in France were
infinitely easier than the drab years of Lantern Marsh
promising no release. Long since he had forgotten his
reception on returning from Lockwood—the jeers, the
confident “I told you so” of his father, the stern promise
of sterner treatment if he repeated the nonsense. The
cause of his rejection by the army seemed unbelievably
trivial, but on later consulting a civil oculist in Lockwood
some kind of eye-trouble was discovered, with the
result that Mauney adopted glasses. Even with this
correction he was advised that he would not be able to
qualify for general service abroad, and the prospect
of entering home service in some dismal camp dissuaded
him from further efforts to be accepted. By this time
a few of the younger set in Beulah had enlisted, thereby
establishing among their relatives a local cult of patriots
who were never backward in snobbishly cutting
others who had not gone. William was too thick-skinned
to feel this, while Mauney was proud enough never to
explain his very sufficient reason for remaining at home.</p>

<p>Then came rumors of conscription, the first feature
of the war that promised to affect the Bard household.
Bard himself was furious for he saw plainly that his
elder son fell into the first group of unmarried men
who would be called up. Mauney took a silent delight
in the discomfiture of both. As the date approached
for the new law to go into force he kept picturing the
cataclysm of feelings that would be aroused, the unwilling
departure of his husky brother and his father’s unavailing
expostulation. It was the latter which really
delighted Mauney, since he had come to regard his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
father’s will as the one stupendously efficient thing in
life, never to be crossed or defeated. A great eagerness
possessed him to see the law in force and to behold,
just for once, with his own eyes, the spectacle of his
father’s spiritual collapse. The time approached with
much rebellious comment from within his own home
and that of other farmers who had until now had few
reminders of war except higher prices for all their products.
At last the evening arrived, the last evening of
freedom for all potential conscripts, and Mauney sat in
the kitchen with his father, awaiting the return of his
brother who had gone to Beulah apparently to make a
closer survey of the impending situation. At a late
hour, William returned.</p>

<p>“Well?” said Bard, eagerly rising as his son entered
the kitchen, “What about it?”</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” William replied with a sly smile.
“They won’t get me, Dad.”</p>

<p>He had married Evelyn Boyce.</p>

<p>Mauney’s astonishment was only less than his instinctive
hatred of an action so basely material and selfish.
When he learned the facts of William’s evening sojourn
in the village he flushed and regarded his brother with
eyes that the brother could read only too plainly.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” William blurted.</p>

<p>“With whom?” Mauney asked.</p>

<p>“You.”</p>

<p>“I’m feeling sorry.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“For Evelyn Boyce, of course.”</p>

<p>William’s face colored quickly and the big veins of
his neck stood out. He stood, stiffening his arms, then
with a savage glare, he shook his fist at his brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“You better keep your mouth shut,” he fumed, “or
I’ll shut it for you. What I do is my business, not
yours.”</p>

<p>In this principle William had the full paternal support
and Mauney once more witnessed the complete success
of his father’s will. The plans had been made out
carefully, beforehand. It was not many days until the
bride was established with her husband on the McBratney
farm and only three were left at the old homestead.
Mrs. William Bard was a brainless, pretty girl of small
physique, with a novel love of chickens, and of a screeching
gramophone whose music could be heard each evening,
when the wind was in the east. Occasionally she
accompanied her husband on short evening visits to her
father-in-law’s, and quite won Bard’s affections by sitting
on his knee and lighting matches for him on the
sole of her shoe. Toward her brother-in-law she
adopted a surprising attitude of coquetry, that displeased
her husband, and caused Mauney a degree of nausea.
It was soon evident that she was not born to be the wife
of William Bard. Beneath her empty hilarity there
was to be gradually discerned a growing girlish discontent
with things. Her attentions to her father-in-law
grew less spontaneous and her flirting manner with
Mauney came to have suggestions of pathetic appeal.
Mauney felt that he could read beneath the surface the
awakening to consciousness of one, who, having been
bought for a purpose, would insist on demanding her
price, for, vapid though her mind was, she possessed a
sharp sense of justice in matters affecting herself. In
the following summer William purchased a motor-car
under pressure, and began taking his wife for evening
drives, much to the elder Bard’s outspoken disapproval.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s too much gadding about, Bill,” he said one
day as they talked matters over. “You’ve got to cut
out this here flyin’ all over the country.”</p>

<p>“What am I goin’ to do?” demanded William, impatiently.
“You know I didn’t want to marry her, but
you advised me to. So now, you can put up with what
I got, see!”</p>

<p>Life offered no solution for Mauney’s inner troubles.
If there had been one cheerful event to annul the interminable
gloom of these years of war, or one friend to
brighten the unlifting fogs that settled down upon him
like the vapors of Lantern Marsh itself, he might have
borne his discontent with greater patience. But the raw
wound in his nature, made by no sudden sword-gash,
but worn there by the attrition of dreary seasons, grew
more unbearable. Every hope that had dared to rise
had been forced down as by a vigilant, hateful fate.
Every finer instinct had met its counterpart of external
opposition. Every aspiration that trembled gently upward
had been tramped by heavy feet, as violets in
the path of horses. He had lived with his newspaper.
He had watched the verdure of the springtimes fade
beneath the dry suns of autumn, the green apples of his
orchard redden and fall to earth, the birds of the swamp
wing away to their southern homes, when ice bound the
Lantern Marsh in its grip and biting winds hurled the
snow in deep banks about the home. And as unchanging
as the seasons he had watched his father’s character
deepen to its fixed qualities of greed and selfishness.</p>

<p>But an end was in sight.</p>

<p>Through the hot summer of endless labor in the fields,
and of endless mind gropings, came vague breezes that
touched his cheeks with promise of liberty. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
breathed a new hope that he scarcely dared to heed,
for these mysterious breezes, as if they were the breath
of fearless gentle angels, brought indistinguishable whisperings,
to which he more and more bent his
ear. Pausing in the field to lean momentarily on the
handle of his hay-fork his eye turned quickly as if to
catch an elusive presence that he felt nearby. But
there was no one. He was quite alone save for his
father and the others casting up great cocks of hay upon
the wagon. But as he sat of an evening on the front
steps of the farmhouse this haunting presence would
come again, eluding his gaze that sought it among the
orchard trees, heavy with their apple harvest. In his
room at night he felt it directly behind him, and came to
realize at length that it was the man he wanted to be,
the prefigurement of a new Mauney Bard.</p>

<p>And the wisps of angel breath, with their sybilline
intonations, began to be articulate, telling of a world of
promise for the valiant, of knowledge, of friends, of
hope.</p>

<p>He had waited for life to help him, but it offered
no help. With spirits partially crushed by the mundane
atmosphere and the endlessly sordid philosophy of his
detested home he had waited in dejection. But, in the
summer of 1916, recognizing at length that no power
existed to help him but himself, he openly rebelled. One
day he went to his father after dinner, as the latter
smoked idly in the kitchen, chatting with the hired
woman. Mauney was finally beside himself.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he said without introduction, “I’m just
about through with you and Lantern Marsh. Here I’ve
been cooped up for years, just simply staying because
there was nothing else to do. I want an education and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
by heavens, I’m going to have it. I think you ought to
give me enough to go to college. But if you won’t, I’m
going anyway.”</p>

<p>The woman, recognizing the private nature of their
conversation, left them alone in the room.</p>

<p>The weight of Mauney’s ultimatum lay as heavily on
Bard’s face as the noon sun on the yard outside the window.
For minutes he sat with his head between his
large, knotty hands, staring blankly at the table oil-cloth,
Mauney felt a flickering pity for him, presented
thus with a flat proposition from which no selfish escape
seemed possible. Bard did not speak, nor did his
face betray his thoughts. It was the tired face of a
man weary with his efforts to coerce life, confronted at
last with a problem that lay beyond his personal power.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, looking up at length like one, who,
though unable to command, still hopes to barter. “If
you’ll stay on here I’ll will you the farm and give you
a quarter interest in the business now.”</p>

<p>“Dad, you don’t understand,” said Mauney, “I want
education. I’m sick of farming and don’t intend to stay
with it. I want to go to College and, as I told you, I’m
going, anyway—”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Bard simply and nodded his head
many times. “You may regret this, boy, I think you
will. Your first duty is to me. And I—”</p>

<p>The sound of horses’ steps distracted his attention
and, turning toward the window, he recognized a well-known
stallion being led by a man in a sulky.</p>

<p>“There’s Thompson, now,” he said. “I have to go to
the barn. But that’s all I’ve got to say, Maun.” He
paused to strike the table with his fist. “Stay with me
and I’ll share up. But if you want to pull out, you do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
it on your own hook. Not a cent from me, sir—not a
cent!”</p>

<p>He walked toward the door, but turned to cast a
glance at Mauney’s serious face.</p>

<p>“You better think it over,” he said. “It’s a purty
big step, sir—a purty big step, I tell yuh.”</p>

<p>As he left to direct Thompson and the stallion to the
barn, Mauney buried his face in his arms.</p>

<p>There could be no turning back on his resolve. His
father’s offer was no inducement. Life at Lantern
Marsh had taken all these years to reach its logical termination—he
must go. To himself he owed something
and the debt disturbed him. Beyond the confines of the
present he dreamed of self development and a great
happiness. He did not know how long he had sat at
the table, thrilled by his new determination, but it must
have been many minutes. He was suddenly disturbed
by the sound of hurrying feet and by the woman’s voice,
as she dashed into the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Maun!” she cried excitedly. “Get into Thompson’s
gig and go get the doctor. Your father’s hurt!”</p>

<p>“What happened him?” asked Mauney, rising.</p>

<p>“Don’t know. He was in with the horses. Hurry
Maun, fer God’s sake, I’m afraid he’s killed by the way
Thompson ran out.”</p>

<p>Mauney ran across the yard to untie Thompson’s
horse, but could see no evidence of tragedy. The sun
lay heavily upon the manure pile and no sound disturbed
the blue shadows of the stable windows. As he jumped
into the sulky and, reaching for the whip, drove quickly
down the lane, he saw the woman running toward the
barn with a pail of water. His mind was a blank during
that race to Beulah. He forgot everything that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
turned in his brain a few moments before. He only felt
that something horrible had happened. He caught mental
images of his father’s face, rendered grotesque and
abominable, but he put the pictures from him, and
glanced for relief at the placid meadows along which he
was flying at top speed. It seemed that he would never
complete his journey when, all at once, he pulled up the
lathered horse by Dr. Horne’s lamp post.</p>

<p>He jumped out and had run only half-way to the office
door when he beheld the burly physician, bare-headed,
carrying his satchel.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, young fellow?” he asked.</p>

<p>“My father’s kicked by a horse,” Mauney quickly
explained, “and I guess it’s bad.”</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>“Down in our barn.”</p>

<p>Horne pointed to the office.</p>

<p>“Go in there, young fellow,” he said. “On the back
of the back door is the key to my barn. Hitch up my
horse and follow me. I’ll drive this race horse of
Thompson’s. Take your time, young fellow,” he added,
as Mauney ran toward the office. “You aren’t the doctor.
Just drive down slow, mind.”</p>

<p>Later when Mauney had nervously succeeded in hitching
up Doctor Horne’s horse and was driving quickly
homeward he wondered why he had been asked to drive
so slowly. The horse seemed in good condition and in
the habit of running, so he made no effort to stop him.
Suddenly, though, at the outskirts of the town, as they
passed the last houses, the horse slowed down to an easy
trot, a matter of habit, too, as Mauney humorously reflected.
At length, he reached home, but saw nobody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
in the yard. Thompson’s horse was wandering slowly
by the end of the drive shed, nibbling the short grass.
Mauney got out and tied the doctor’s horse to the iron
weight which he had taken from the buggy. For a
moment he gazed toward the barn. There was the open
stable door, the empty windows, the enlarging blue
shadow of the building creeping toward the end of the
manure heap, but no movement, save that of a white
hen, picking in the straw that littered the ground. He
slowly turned and entered the kitchen where, stretched
upon the sofa, he discovered the woman, sobbing hysterically.</p>

<p>“How is he?” Mauney asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I don’t know,” she managed to say,
turning over on her face and biting her finger. “I went
over to get Bill, but he’s in the back field. I guess you
better get him, Maun. I—I can’t walk no further!”</p>

<p>On his way to the lane Mauney saw the doctor, in
his shirt sleeves, coming across the barnyard toward the
kitchen. He waited for him, reflecting that he had
never seen the physician walk so slowly.</p>

<p>“Well, Mauney,” he said seriously, as he came up.
“God knows this isn’t the kind of thing I like to do. I
feel damned sorry for you.”</p>

<p>“Is he—is he dead, doctor?”</p>

<p>Horne slowly nodded his big, black head, while tears
filled his big, black eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, poor Seth Bard,” he said with a sigh. “He
was a good farmer, was Seth. He never knew what hit
him. Well, that’s the way it goes.”</p>

<div class="epigraph">

<p>“The house is a fine house when good folks are
within.”—<cite>George Herbert’s Collection, 1639.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Mauney was seated in the green-upholstered seat
of a railway car, with a ticket in his pocket marked
Merlton. His baggage, consisting of a new trunk and
two new leather suit-cases, was safely on board, or so
he found himself anxiously hoping from time to time,
as the train quickened its speed. He wore a new grey serge
suit, purchased in Lockwood, the town from whose outskirts
he was now passing, a suit that clung neatly to his
big shoulders with a strange, new feeling of smartness.
On his head reposed an attractive grey, soft hat with a
black band, itself as new as the rest—as new as all the
weird experiences of the present day which had kept
him busy and curious. He was dazed by the rapid
events, as if he had not become implicated voluntarily,
but was being led by a magic power.</p>

<p>He was going to Merlton. That was the only fact of
which he was momentarily certain, except that his
brother William had motored him to Lockwood the
previous night, and that he had sat beside Evelyn in
the back seat, trying to steal time to think of a multitude
of different matters that naturally flooded his mind.
But he found it quite impossible and gave over eventually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
to her sentimental jabber concerning the marvellous
character of his newly-contemplated life in Merlton, how
much she herself would love to be coming, and how
tedious life would be at Lantern Marsh without him.
“Tedious,” scarcely described it, for, since the death of
his father, especially during the unpleasant process of
settling the estate, in which process William had proved
to be a very difficult person, he had realized a great
tragedy in the atmosphere of the place. It depended
not only on memories of his father’s end, but equally
also upon William’s implanted selfishness. There had
been scenes in the lawyer’s office between the brothers,
and William’s contentiousness had created a hateful
situation from which Mauney had glided easily along
peaceful exits of least resistance. As a result the
brother retained the original farm besides money, and
Mauney took for his share twelve thousand dollars,
with half the proceeds from the sale of the McBratney
farm sometime in sight.</p>

<p>It had all been too drastically tragic to be tedious.
Nothing quite so upsetting and revolutionary had ever
occurred as the sudden death of his father. It had altered
everything, like the stroke of a magician’s wand.
Here he was, for example, dressed as well as any man
on the train, departing, probably forever, from scenes
which until recently had been prison-like. Here he was,
with more nerve than sense—or so he felt—launching
without advice from anybody, straight at the metropolis,
drawn thither like a shad-fly to an arc-light. Here he
was with money enough and more for an education, but
without the faintest idea of how to go about it. Above
all, here he was, the loneliest chap imaginable, without
one friend to talk to, and nothing ahead but a bleak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
horizon of uncertain years and an absolutely unfamiliar
world.</p>

<p>He almost longed, by a natural reversion of feeling,
for the old times at home, for his father cursing him
roundly, for William’s sneers, for poor old Snowball’s
silent laughter, doubly silent now, and for the hired
woman’s rough sympathy.</p>

<p>During these cogitations he frequently interrupted
himself to finger his vest pocket and be assured that he
had lost neither the ticket marked <i>Merlton</i> nor the baggage
checks. The casual observer, knowing nothing of
Mauney’s previous existence, would have received an
impression of a young, well-to-do man, of kindly disposition,
of keen sensibilities, and of, perhaps, unusual
powers of mind. He might have passed for a young
commercial traveller, save that his eyes possessed a
glamor of imagination too vivid to have long withstood
the prosaic details of business, and yet, on the other
hand, though his bright face, nearly smiling, might have
been that of an artist, there was about him a certain air
of staid reserve that negatived the impression.</p>

<p>But these golden opinions about the young man in
the grey suit, were, to be sure, purely from without,
since there existed within Mauney a much poorer estimate.
He would have said that of all the people on
this train he was unquestionably the most ignorant, the
most awkward, the most lamentably inexperienced. He
was going forth into the enigmatical universe unsupported,
but with a kind of mock self-assurance approaching
bluff. And he was stepping very rapidly
along, pushed by uninvited and irrevocable events, with
inelegant steps, as if his body were being bunted from
behind. A big truck-load of baggage at the Lockwood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Station platform had given him the same feeling a few
moments previously. He wished the train would go
more slowly, because of the importance of the journey.
After all it was the real transition, the deportation from
one phase of life to the unrealized next one, and certainly
no occasion for being hurtled along with terrific
speed, but rather one for slow adjustment of mind and
body. He had never worn as stiff a collar, but the
clothier in Lockwood must be relied upon. The seat
of his trousers seemed tight, but that too, was undoubtedly
a matter for the ruling judgment of an expert.</p>

<p>Well, he would try to bluff it bravely. Just what he
would do on reaching Merlton was uncertain. There
were the hotels, if necessary, but he felt that the sooner
he got right down to work the better for his peace of
mind. He wanted to go to the university, but knew that,
unless he could discover some way of circumventing a
high school training, college halls were very distant.
Here again he would have to rely on expert opinion. In
fact, he philosophized that he was now in a world where
he was no longer independent. The lazy come and go
of Lantern Marsh was realized to be at an end. He
was now exploring hazy territory and so decided to
keep out his feelers. There was nothing else for it
than to be patient and wait, and go easy, and keep his
feelers out. After all it was a wonderfully thrilling experience,
containing as much opportunity for spiritual
enjoyment as for discomfort.</p>

<p>Pulling down his collar out of the crease of his neck
he cast his eye at a book which his seat companion was
reading. The title at the top of the page was “Biochemistry.”
The reader was a young, black-haired
fellow with an eager, enthusiastic face, but with a deep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
vertical crotchet of puckered skin between his eyebrows.
That he was not reading for pleasure was
doubly evident from his impatient manner of turning
over new pages and from the monotonous tone in which,
from time to time, he half spoke what he read. At
length he finished a chapter, slammed the book shut and
sat comfortably back with a sigh of relief. Mauney
would not have ventured to speak to him, and was
therefore pleasantly surprised, anon, to be addressed
by the other.</p>

<p>“Awful stuff this!” said the stranger, tapping the
closed volume with his knuckle.</p>

<p>“What is Biochemistry?” Mauney enquired curiously.</p>

<p>“Oh!” drawled the other, with a perplexed look, “it’s
the study of the chemical processes that go on in the
animal body—awful headache, this stuff! Are you going
to Merlton?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” nodded Mauney.</p>

<p>“Go to the University?”</p>

<p>“Not yet.”</p>

<p>“But you are later, eh?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Mauney explained. “I want to go,
but I haven’t had enough education to get in.”</p>

<p>“You don’t need much, I can assure you,” said the
other. “You’ve got your Collegiate off, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“No. Just public school.”</p>

<p>“Well, of course that means a devil of a lot of preliminary
ahead of you, and they’re getting crankier up
there every minute about that stuff. By the way,” he
said, after stealing an appraising glance at Mauney’s face
and clothing. “My name is Lee.”</p>

<p>Mauney took his proffered hand and shook it warmly.</p>

<p>“Bard is mine,” he said, a little awkwardly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“We may as well know each other, Mr. Bard,” said
Lee, sitting up and smiling. “I’m just going back to
the city to write off some sups. Do you know what I
mean? Well, I hope you don’t ever learn by experience.
I got ploughed in Biochemistry, this spring. Do
you know what I mean? Well, at the exams, you
see, I went down hard on this stuff. So I’ve got to plug
it up and write it off, now.”</p>

<p>Lee followed his explanation by a glance of curiosity
at Mauney’s face before smiling indulgently.</p>

<p>“You’ll get on to these college expressions sooner or
later. Of course I like my work well enough,” he explained,
“and I shouldn’t have dropped on this dope,
didn’t expect to either—it’s kind of made me bolsheviki
for the present. I hope you’ll pardon my seeming rudeness
if I continue to sink myself in this book?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, shoot into the dope, hard,” ventured
Mauney.</p>

<p>With a look of surprise Lee settled down into the
depths of the seat and, before commencing a new chapter,
stole a sly, curious glance at his new acquaintance,
while Mauney, faintly satisfied at his recent attempt at
slang, found courage and a somewhat new belief in his
own powers of adaptation.</p>

<p>Lee, buried in a new chapter, continued to frown,
slap the pages, and repeat ill-temperedly passage after
passage, while Mauney would turn from the window
and its vision of long farm lands turning rapidly past
like the spokes of a great wheel, to snatch a glance over
his companion’s shoulders, to read perhaps a snatch of
technical treatise concerning the combustion of fatty
acids (whatever they might be), or to notice complicated
designs of apparatus, reminding him of puzzles he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
seen in the <cite>Beulah Weekly</cite>. Lee, he noticed, was an appealing
sort, though delicate, with long, thin hands and
a thin body that bent easily into his slouched attitude
of reading. Over his vest he wore a thin, low-cut
jersey whose front was decorated with a large, blue
M, ornamented with wings sprouting from the two upright
limbs of the letter. Mauney deduced that it stood
for Merlton, probably being a trophy bestowed for
prowess in some particular sport at the University of
Merlton. At length Lee finished another chapter and
closed the book with a snap, dropping it into his black
hand-bag under the seat.</p>

<p>“That’s enough of that,” he said. “Pass or no pass
I’m not going to read any more of it. And, more than
that, I’m going to see a good show to-night. What do
you say if we go?”</p>

<p>“How long before we reach Merlton?” Mauney asked.</p>

<p>Lee glanced at his wrist watch. “It’s two-forty. We
don’t get there till six-thirty. Deuce of a long trip!
It’ll be too late to do anything but a show.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to go all right,” Mauney admitted, “but I
want to find some place to stay.”</p>

<p>“What kind of digs are you after—you know, what
kind of a place?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t a very good idea myself.”</p>

<p>Lee studied Mauney’s open face for a moment as if
trying to decide what category to place him in. It was
evident from his own expression that he found something
likeable about his new acquaintance, for he smiled
with combined indulgence and curiosity.</p>

<p>“What have you been working at, Mr. Bard?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Farming, all my life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I see. Decided to shake the plough now?”</p>

<p>Mauney nodded. “Yes, I wouldn’t have stayed so
long at it, only you know how circumstances sometimes
determine a fellow’s fate.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing, you said something,” admitted Lee, a
little sadly. “I’d have been in the army except for the
astounding circumstance, quite a surprise to me, that
some imaginative medical officer fancied he heard a
menagerie inside of my chest. There’s never been a
thing wrong with me,” he affirmed, “but just because
that chap with the stethescope didn’t like the way I
breathed, I am here to-day, plugging along in third year
medicine. Why! I managed to clean up the intercollegiate
tennis last fall. I cite that merely as evidence of
health.”</p>

<p>“You can’t tell me anything about it,” Mauney
laughed. “I got turned down on account of my eyes.
But I only have to wear glasses when I read. Eyes are
good. I’d have been away long ago except for that.
It’s tough luck to get treated like that. However, I’m
ready any time they want to take me. But, war or no
war, Mr. Lee, I’m not going to beg them to take me. I
practically did that once; so I feel it’s their move next.”</p>

<p>“Hear, hear! My heart’s in the right place, too.
Though I hate to be regarded as a slacker by those who
don’t know the details. Sometimes I think it takes as
much grit to face the home forces as the Germans. I
mean the why-aren’t-you-at-the-war brand. However,
got to put up with it. Say,” he added presently. “How
would you like to get a room at my boarding house?”</p>

<p>“Fine. Could I?”</p>

<p>“I believe you probably could,” he said, “It’s a queer
sort of digs, but just unusual enough to be interesting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
It’s worth making an effort to get into it, too. The
bunch there are off the beaten path—never was quite
able to size ’em up—but they all mind their own business.
You know,” he said reflectively, “I’ve been there over a
year and I can’t tell you just what keeps me there. I
guess it’s because we’re all rebels.”</p>

<p>“Rebels?” repeated Mauney, in great surprise.</p>

<p>“Surely,” nodded Lee with a broad smile breaking
over his face. “Do you know what it means to be out
of love with life?”</p>

<p>“I—I should say I do. That’s me exactly.”</p>

<p>“I thought so, Mr. Bard,” replied Lee with an intimate
little sparkle in his eye. “I judged you to have
something of the same spirit about you. Well, it’s a
kind of grouch that lurks under the surface, if you will.
Anyhow, it’s easily recognized by anyone who is a rebel
himself.”</p>

<p>Mauney’s blue eyes narrowed as he glanced at his
new friend’s face.</p>

<p>“Are you a rebel, Mr. Lee?” he asked seriously.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Lee. Then he laughed at Mauney’s
sober aspect. “Don’t be alarmed. My disaffection has
not, at present, any political aspect, you know. My rebellion
is not against the government. It’s just a plain,
homely, disposition of grouch.”</p>

<p>“I see,” smiled Mauney. “Do you know, I like that.”</p>

<p>“And I knew you would, my son,” continued Lee,
almost affectionately. “You’ve got inoculated, somehow,
with the same virus. You’ve caught the disease
somewhere. We belong to a great fraternity that doesn’t
wear any silver badge. A person has to be born to it,
to some degree, and then he has to get properly messed
up, into the bargain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“How do you mean—messed up?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just that everything goes wrong. Plans smashed,
ideas smashed, everything smashed,” laughed Lee with
just a small trace of queer seriousness in his face. “Fate
picks out a few of us to join this big fraternity. We
always know each other when we meet without any
masonic sign. Our watchword is discontent—unexplainable
discontent. We are just misfits, my son,” he
concluded, with a slap at Mauney’s knee.</p>

<p>Mauney could not help liking his new friend who,
though evidently not much older than himself, called
him “my son” so easily, and who, either consciously or
otherwise, had succeeded in establishing a most unexpected
bond between them. But his skillful, verbal harangue
on the present topic was still puzzling to him, so
that, after a moment, he put a question.</p>

<p>“Do you mean that the people who live at this boarding
house all belong to a secret fraternity?”</p>

<p>“Yes and no!” said Lee. “It’s a fraternity, as I’ve
said, secret enough from all who don’t belong. But it
hasn’t any organized constitution and no particular
purpose or aim.” As he paused, his black eyes softened
with a visionary aspect. “It’s distributed all over the
world. You don’t join it. You’re either in it or not.
If you’re in it you find it impossible to get too much
worked up over any enthusiasm. You prefer irony to
barbarous optimism. You retire by choice, into the
shadow of things. Do you get me?”</p>

<p>“I think so, yes,” nodded Mauney. “You all feel out
of gear with things, all the time.”</p>

<p>“That’s it. You can’t get an ideal which isn’t sooner
or later rendered a mere idea. Your hands slip off from
the round edges of everything you grasp. You know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
before you start that your efforts will eventually peter
down to child’s play. Well, well,” he said, pulling himself
up out of his half reverie. “I suppose I’d better
read some more biochemistry.”</p>

<p>“Do you like the study of medicine?” asked Mauney.</p>

<p>Lee smiled.</p>

<p>“I like it all right,” he nodded. “But it’s just like me
to get the wrong angle on it. I keep wondering about
the profession—it’s so damned illogical.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p>“We patch people up after they’re damaged, instead
of trying to keep ’em from getting damaged. We throw
out the life-line, but we don’t teach ’em to swim. It’s
all topsy-turvy philosophy, upside down, cart before the
horse. However,” he said with a drawl as he opened
his hand-grip to take out his book, “I’ve decided not to
revolutionize the world, just yet. It’s a game, my son,
but worth playing, after all.”</p>

<p>He was soon lost in the pages of his big Biochemistry
volume again, and Mauney contented himself with reconstructing
Lee’s philosophy. It struck him as perhaps
picturesque, but unnecessarily bleak. No, he did not
quite agree with his new friend. There was use in
things. Just the prospect of an education was sufficient
now to lift Mauney into a mood of happiness. To turn
from mental darkness to mental light, to learn of the
mysterious forces that promulgated life on the globe and
kept it living, to know how peoples had lived and how
they lived now, to pierce the meaning of war. In short,
to pick the pearls of knowledge from the vast, pebbled
coast-line of life—this was a task and an opportunity
that thrilled him with splendid resolve and high hopes.</p>

<p>When they reached Merlton Union the platforms bore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
a busy swarm of humanity through which the two new
friends made their way with difficulty to the great waiting
room. Mauney had a sense of being suddenly
dropped into a seething sea of being that emphasized
his own minuteness. People sitting, tired and impatient.
People walking eagerly about, searching for friends.
People consulting official-looking clerks in information
booths, or rushing at the heels of red-caps who carried
their valises to departing trains. The great roar of the
room rose to the high expanse of the roof, like the rushing
sound heard in a sea-shell. Individual sounds were
lost and swallowed up in the vague, but intense vibrations
that beat back from the glazed ceiling, to be disturbed
only by the deep, sonorous voice of a man by
the gates who called the trains in measured periods,
each speech ending in a wistful, sad inflection. Here
were people, coming and going, as if it were the very
business of life and not, as in Mauney’s case, the great
epoch-making event of his whole existence. At the
curb, outside the front entrance, he was dismayed by
the mad rush of snorting taxi-cabs, pausing but long
enough to take their passengers before darting off down
the crowded street.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” said Lee, pressing his long forefinger
against Mauney’s vest buttons. “Suppose you give your
baggage cheques to the city delivery here, then take my
grip and go up to the boarding house. Tell Mrs. Manton
I’ll be up later. You don’t need to say anything yet
about getting a room there. Things are done very deliberately
at seventy-three Franklin Street, as you’ll
find. Tell her you’re waiting for me. Then just sort
of edge in slowly. If she doesn’t ask you to sit down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
just grab a chair and make yourself comfortable. Be
sociable. Do you get me?”</p>

<p>Mauney nodded.</p>

<p>“I’m all for a show to-night,” Lee continued, “so
I’ll be off to one now. If you’re hungry ask Gertrude
for something to eat.”</p>

<p>“Who’s Gertrude?” asked Mauney.</p>

<p>“The landlady, Mrs. Manton. She’ll love you if you
do. Don’t be bashful, see? And I’ll be home around
midnight and we’ll have a chat before we turn in.”</p>

<p>Soon he had gone, leaving Mauney holding his grip
and waving for a taxi. One promptly disjoined itself
from a waiting line, while an attendant opened the door.</p>

<p>“Where, sir?” asked the driver, craning his neck
about.</p>

<p>“No. seventy-three Franklin Street.”</p>

<p>He nodded and away they flew through congested
thoroughfares, missing other motor cars by what seemed
veritable hair-breadths, passing noisy street-cars, avoiding
wary pedestrians who ventured across their way.
After traversing what appeared to be the business section
of the city, they began to pass along quieter streets
and eventually stopped in front of a respectable red-brick
house. Mauney paid the driver and got out to inspect
the residence. It was a three storey building,
squarish in appearance, with a side verandah leading to
the only entrance. The cream-colored shades of the
front lower room were drawn. As Mauney paused to
survey the place a few drops of rain struck his face; so
that he hurried up the broad steps, along the verandah
to the door, and rang the bell. It was already growing
dusk and he could make out nothing through the door-window.
Presently a light was switched on and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
saw the figure of a man approaching, who, when he
had opened the door, regarded Mauney silently from an
expressionless face.</p>

<p>“Does Mrs. Manton live here?”</p>

<p>“Sure! Come in,” invited the man. He was about
forty—short, thick-set, agreeable. His smooth, flabby
face, devoid of color, was as grey as his short hair,
and he had lazy, mirthful, grey eyes, and a lazy smile
that exposed many gold teeth. He struck Mauney as
a flippant individual. When he had closed the door he
turned about and called, “Ho, Gertrude!” Then he
faced Mauney again.</p>

<p>“Is it going to rain?” he asked good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“It’s raining now a little.”</p>

<p>The man produced a penknife, opened it, and pried
with the blade between his gold-filled incisors. “I knew
it was going to rain,” he said. “I’ve got the most expensive
barometers here I could afford. These teeth
have cost me more money than I’ve got in the bank,
and they always ache before a storm. What do you
know about that?”</p>

<p>Mauney smiled. “It’s hard luck; that’s all I can think
of at the moment.” He was trying to follow Lee’s advice
about being sociable, and striving with equal effort
to gauge the stranger’s disposition and character. He
remembered that Lee had also mentioned the importance
of making himself at home. Accordingly, he now
removed his hat and hung it on the hall rack, then
walked to a hall chair and seated himself comfortably,
while the stranger followed his movements with an
amused, curious smile.</p>

<p>“Ho! Gertrude!” he called again. Then, after lighting
a cigarette and flipping the burnt match into an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
empty brass jardiniere on the hall stand, he glanced at
Mauney. “She’s still the same old Gert,” he explained,
as if presupposing a former acquaintanceship to have
existed between Mauney and his landlady.</p>

<p>“Is she?”</p>

<p>“Sure! She’s in on a little game in the dining room
now. I guess she’s building up a jack-pot and don’t
want to decamp.”</p>

<p>Just then a burst of mixed laughter was heard. The
door at one side of the hall-way opened and Mauney
obtained his first view of Mrs. Manton. Her appearance
was not typical of landladies, as Mauney had fancied
them. In fact her appearance denied that she was
a landlady at all, but suggested that she had just walked
out of a theatre at the opposite end from the audience.
Mauney had seen pictures of actresses in magazines,
and as he beheld Mrs. Manton the word “Spanish”
flashed in his mind. She wore an extreme costume of
black velvet, with yellow silk facings, and an artificial
red poppy stuck into her heavy stock of jet-black
hair. About her neck was a long string of pearls, and
on her fingers diamonds were flashing in the light. For
a moment she regarded Mauney curiously, then walked,
with an unhurried, precise, but rhythmic grace that
suited her solid, short form, until she stood near him.
He rose.</p>

<p>“Good-evening,” she said in a deep, purring voice that
was very soothing. “I fear you have the advantage of
me.”</p>

<p>“My name’s Bard,” he said quickly, smiled, and stuck
out his hand.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Mr. Bard,” she replied with a
brightening of her swarthy, pensive face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“I came up to wait for Mr. Lee,” he explained.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Lee is home on his vacation, Mr. Bard,
and won’t be back till about October, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he will,” Mauney corrected. “He’ll be here
to-night! I just came up on the train with him. You
see he got ploughed in biochemistry, and had to come
up to write the dope off. Stars and sups, you know.”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” she exclaimed. “Poor old Max! Well,
we will be glad to have Max with us again, eh Freddie?”</p>

<p>“You bet. He’s sure a winner, Gertrude,” replied the
man who was now introduced to Mauney as Stalton.</p>

<p>“Fred,” she said, “you better go up and see if Max’s
room’s all right, will you?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing.”</p>

<p>“And now Mr. Bard,” said Mrs. Manton, indicating
the dining-room door by a graceful gesture of her bejewelled
hand. “We’ve got on a friendly game of poker,
if you’d care to join with us while you wait for Max?”</p>

<p>“I’ve always been unlucky at poker,” prevaricated
Mauney, who had never seen the game.</p>

<p>“Ho,” she laughed. “You’re like me. I’m the greatest
she Jonah that has been discovered to date. Never
mind, it’s only a nickel-ante.”</p>

<p>“That’s not much, is it?” he ventured.</p>

<p>“Of course, we never allow big games, you know,”
she explained, as her dark eyes indulged in a scrutiny
of his features. “Just a pastime. May be you’d prefer
to read, or perhaps just watch the game?”</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Mauney, touching her on the breast
with his forefinger, just as Lee had done with him at
the Union Station. “I’m about starved—hungry as
sin. Do you suppose you could rig me up a bite to eat?”</p>

<p>“Why, you poor boy!” she purred softly, and took his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
arm to lead him to the dining room. “Just off the train.
Of course you’ll have a snack directly.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Mrs. Manton.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” she said indifferently, in a tone that indicated
that thanking was not quite normal to seventy-three
Franklin Street. “Sadie Grote’s in here. She’ll
fix you up.”</p>

<p>The dining-room was a spacious chamber with a large
central table. A drop-lamp, whose large oval shade in
the design of a huge yellow water lily hung low over
the table, distributed a cone of light that revealed four
or five people busy at cards about the table. Mauney’s
eye caught the other details of the room—a large fire-place
at one side, a long Chesterfield couch under the
window at one end, with a man reclining on it, a sideboard,
with a mirror and a display of glassware upon
it, a cabinet gramophone, several large easy chairs, and
a smoker’s ash stand.</p>

<p>“I can wait awhile for the grub,” said Mauney, who
was really too excited with his new boarding house to
be hungry.</p>

<p>“All right. We’ll all be eating after a while,” Mrs.
Manton replied. Then, turning to the crowd, “This is
Mr. Bard,” she said, simply, took her chair at the table
and picked up her hand of cards. Mauney, left to his
own devices, sat down in one of the easy chairs and
familiarized himself with his surroundings. Besides
his landlady were two other women, one addressed as
Mrs. Dixon, a fleshy person of forty, with fat, ring-adorned
fingers, the other, evidently Sadie Grote, a
pretty wisp of a girl top-heavy with blonde hair. One
of the men, known familiarly as “Doc,” was a painfully
bald individual of fifty, whose speech and gestures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
breathed a foreign atmosphere, and whose erect body
had a military poise. The other man, not over thirty,
was heavily built, but had an effeminate smile that exposed
teeth perfect enough to be envied by the most
renowned beauty. He was called “Cliff,” and seemed to
have been fascinated by Mrs. Manton, although she
treated him with discouraging indifference.</p>

<p>The man on the sofa was completely absorbed in a
newspaper, behind which his face was hidden. He lay
for fully twenty minutes without moving a muscle, with
his long legs stretched out to the very end of the couch.
Suddenly he crushed the paper between his hands, and
swung himself up to a sitting posture.</p>

<p>“The damned thieves!” he exclaimed in an English
accent. “Cutting wages at a time like this. The working
man in England to-day is usually either over military
age or else crippled from war service. To think of the
curs cutting down their wages now! Well, it’s only one
more evidence of the fat-headed manner in which everything
is done in England—England, the land of blunders!”</p>

<p>Mauney noticed with surprise that none of the people
at the table were paying any attention to the irate
Englishman’s declamation—the more remarkable that he
should continue:</p>

<p>“If they go on messing things up much worse, the
working man is going to kick over and raise a bit of
hell, and it will serve the skunks jolly well right. I
hope that they put so big a land tax on the capitalists
that they will lose every square foot of property they
possess. It’s not theirs, anyhow. It belongs to the
working man.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Manton presently glanced in his direction to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
behold him still bathed in the glow of his enthusiastic
pronouncement.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong, Jolvin?” she purred softly. “Have
they not yet recognized the rights of the working man?
How discouraging!”</p>

<p>There was a note of sarcasm in her deep, melodious
voice that irritated Jolvin. He had a long, thin face,
scooped out at the temples and the cheeks, a narrow,
black moustache directly under his long, thin nose, and
a permanent dimple in the middle of his long chin. His
long, narrow neck rose out of his collar like a jack-in-the-box,
and he had an uncanny way of suddenly rotating
his face, in conversation, full toward a speaker.</p>

<p>“Oh! damn it! Talk will you!” he fumed, looking
at his landlady out of furious eyes, as if he had been
much more content to have continued in monologue.
“Some people are going to wake up one morning to
discover the working man in possession of the helm of
affairs!”</p>

<p>He jumped to his feet and stamped ill-temperedly
toward the hall door.</p>

<p>“And,” he resumed, as he opened the door quickly,
but paused to give Mrs. Manton the full benefit of his
rage, “this is no dream of a fantastic mind. It’s just
truth, damned-well truth!”</p>

<p>He closed the door violently, while Mrs. Manton
merely put up her hand to tidy her hair, as if Jolvin’s
commotion had disturbed its excellent coiffure. Then
Stalton came softly in from a back hall-way.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with Jolvin to-night?” he enquired
casually.</p>

<p>“Just ranting on Bolshevism, as per usual,” replied
Mrs. Manton, as she dealt out the cards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t ever get him started on socialism,” Stalton
advised. “He got me cornered one night and just about
proved that it was sinful to own property at all. It
gave me a Sunday-school feeling right down to my boots
to think how righteous I was in at least that one respect.”</p>

<p>“That man does irritate, occasionally,” she admitted.
“However, he’s not such a poor sort, at other times.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could play the guitar as well as he can,
Gertrude,” put in Miss Sadie Grote, as she picked up
her cards and examined them.</p>

<p>Stalton walked to a chair, which he pulled up near
Mauney’s.</p>

<p>“That bird,” he said, indicating the door through
which Jolvin had just gone, “is the only Englishman
I ever met who hated England. He’s troubled with a
bad form of ingrowing Anglophobia, and he does everything
possible to Westernize himself. He even plays a
Hawaiian guitar. Any time during the night we’re
liable to hear it mewing like a cat up in his room. If
he keeps on he’s certainly going to qualify for one of
the leading parts in a murder scene.”</p>

<p>Mauney laughed.</p>

<p>“I suppose he’s kind of a rebel,” he ventured.</p>

<p>“Rebel!” repeated Stalton, with a puzzled look in his
eyes. “How do you mean?”</p>

<p>Mauney realized just then that Lee’s categorization
of the people at seventy-three Franklin Street was no
doubt an individualistic bit of philosophy somewhat beyond
the people themselves, so he accordingly changed
the topic of conversation. He was finding them all
very interesting studies—the most unusual people he
had ever known. But, as the evening wore on, dissipated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
by cards and gramophone selections, scraps of
dancing executed fantastically by Mrs. Manton and the
enamoured stranger, whose name he did not learn, he
grew gradually weary of the desultory entertainment,
and wished Lee would return. At length he came.
After receiving warm welcomes from everyone present,
he led Mauney up to his room. The hallway on the
first floor was too dark to give any view of the place
except that Lee’s room was at the front end of the corridor
on the right side, and when illuminated was seen
to be a large, comfortably furnished chamber with two
windows facing Franklin Street, and a flat-topped desk
placed between the windows. Upon the desk were a
long row of large technical volumes, an ink-well, blotters
and a ruler. There were two big, leather-upholstered,
easy chairs in the outer corner of the room, facing
each other, and a small smoker’s stand between them.
Lee raised the windows to freshen the stale air, then
turned in a general survey of the familiar place.</p>

<p>“What do you think of the bunch?” he asked casually,
as he lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>“I like them fine,” said Mauney. “They’re quite
clever, these people.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. So they are,” Lee agreed, as he dropped
wearily into one of the chairs and waved Mauney to
the other. “Are you smoking?”</p>

<p>Mauney raised his hand.</p>

<p>“You know, Mr. Lee,” he smiled, “I’m just a green-horn
from the country. I’ve had quite a lot of new
experiences to-day already. I’m not snobbish about tobacco,
but I’d rather leave that for another day or two,
if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fine,” laughed Lee. “You’ll get along in the world
all right!”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?”</p>

<p>“Surely. You don’t need to take my word for it.
I find that Gertrude is an extremely shrewd judge of
men, and I’d like to tell you what she said about you—if
you wouldn’t misunderstand her.”</p>

<p>Mauney was greatly interested. “No, I won’t. I
like her a lot. What did she say?”</p>

<p>“Well, she said in the kitchen, while she was making
those sandwiches, ‘Where did you get this big, refreshing
country breeze, Max?’ I told her you were coming
to the city for the first time to take up some kind
of academic work, and she looked up at me as if surprised.
‘Clever kid,’ she said. ‘He walked right over
to me like a confidence man at the start. I pretty near
gave him my heart.’ Now, of course,” added Lee,
“when Gertrude feels that way about anybody, he’s
elected!”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, the house is yours. You can stay and board
here. In other words, you gibe, fit in, dovetail—do
you get me? I told her you might like to remain here,
and she just nodded, which means that to-morrow night,
without anything being said about it, a room will be
ready for you to occupy.”</p>

<p>“Do I pay in advance?” Mauney enquired.</p>

<p>“No, no,” laughed Lee, as if at his friend’s inexorable
ignorance; “you don’t do anything of the kind.
She may not ask you for money for a month. Then
she’s liable to suggest it very delicately, and, as a rule,
you give her just a little more than it’s worth—see?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
You pay for atmosphere here and for her peculiar selection
of other guests.”</p>

<p>“How much should I pay a month?”</p>

<p>“Oh, forty-five or fifty is what I usually contribute.
And then, if you ever see any ice-cream or fruit or a
new victrola record or anything in that line, down-town,
you just buy it and bring it home as an occasional treat.”</p>

<p>Mauney sat back in his chair and smiled. There was
a flush of comfort in his face and a new relaxation.
He liked the place, although he was still overcome, almost
exhausted, by the swift changes of the day. Especially
did he like Maxwell Lee, this comforting fellow
with visionary dark eyes who sat opposite him
now, smoking meditatively as if quite aware of the
epoch-making significance of a simple railway journey;
as if he realized how great an event it had really been
to Mauney’s inexperienced soul.</p>

<div class="epigraph">

<p>“I consider it most becoming and most civilized
to mingle severity with good fellowship, so that
the former may not grow into melancholy, nor the
latter into frivolity.”—<cite>Pliny the Younger, Ep. Bk. 8.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>When he awoke in the morning, he was vaguely
conscious of some one talking in the room.
Over the edge of his counterpane his eye caught the
pyjama-ed figure of Lee, shaving in front of the dressing-case
mirror, and he soon realized that Lee was talking
to him.</p>

<p>“—thinking it over,” Lee was saying. “And I believe
your best stunt is to look up a tutor who will give you
your matriculation work extra-murally. That won’t tie
you down to any formality of going to a high school.
You can work as hard as you like, and, at your age,
you’ll clean up that preliminary dope just like ice-cream.”</p>

<p>Mauney sprang out of bed and shaved. He fell in
with Lee’s suggestion and decided that he would look
up a tutor that very morning. He was thrilled with
excitement and happiness. Outside the windows, rain
was splashing on the sills, but it was the merriest, gladdest
rain he had ever listened to. Before him stretched
the great adventure of education, rich in its promise of
compensation for all the years of miserable waiting.
In fact, could it be quite true that he was actually conscious?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Was he not rather treading the air of a delightful
dream, from which, at any moment, he would awake
to bleak realities?</p>

<p>There were only three at the breakfast table when
they descended—Mrs. Manton, seated at the end in a
rich dressing gown of yellow silk, and Jolvin, with Stalton,
at one side. The Englishman, fully dressed as for
business, ate in dignified silence. Stalton, whom to
know was to love, sat in his shirt sleeves without a collar,
as if he had no other business in life than to act
in the capacity of a cross-corner mentor for his landlady.
Mauney was assigned to a place between the two
men, while Lee sat down at the opposite side.</p>

<p>“It’s a grand morning, Mr. Bard,” said Stalton, as
he poured some medicine into a spoon from a large
bottle by his place. Perhaps, thought Mauney, Stalton’s
gray hair and flabby grey face were evidence of
some chronic ailment—the wearing effects of pain. He
felt sorry for his table companion.</p>

<p>“Hello,” laughed Lee, glancing across at the bottle,
“What are you taking now, Freddie?”</p>

<p>“This is a new consignment of dope, Max,” he replied
good-naturedly. “It’s guaranteed to contain the
real wallop. Made up of yeast, raisins, vitamines and
monkey glands. Don’t be surprised to see me challenging
the heavy-weight champion next spring.”</p>

<p>Jolvin, whose mind at the moment may have been
grappling with serious business problems, was evidently
irritated by Stalton’s remark. Suddenly his face
whirled directly about toward Mauney, who nearly
jumped with astonishment. “For God’s sake,” whispered
Jolvin, “I wish he’d stop that stuff at breakfast.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Then his head snapped back to receive the last spoonful
of his cornflakes.</p>

<p>“One would fancy,” he said aloud, “it would stop
raining!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” murmured Stalton. “One would. But I guess
there’s a few bucketfuls left up there yet.”</p>

<p>“How’s the tooth this morning, Freddie?” enquired
Miss Grote, as she walked into the room.</p>

<p>“It’s still in my head, Sadie, but I expected it would
jump out, about two this morning.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake,” whispered Jolvin into Mauney’s
ear; “he can’t talk about anything, but teeth—teeth!”</p>

<p>He made a nervous stab at a rasher of bacon and
cleared his throat. “I fancy,” he said aloud, “we’ll be
getting some prime weather after this!”</p>

<p>“Yes, no doubt,” replied Stalton. “This rain ought
to prime anything, including the cistern pump.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Manton cast a reproving look at Stalton, shook
her head hopelessly, sighed, and continued her breakfast.
Mauney, in the best of spirits himself, unconsciously
cast his sympathy with Stalton.</p>

<p>“Did you hear the rain on the roof last night, Mr.
Stalton?” he asked, by way of making conversation.</p>

<p>“Sure thing.”</p>

<p>“Did it help you to sleep?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t affect me like that, Mr. Bard,” he
answered. “Unfortunately I passed through a period
of my life when I had the rain without the roof, and
rain ever since brings up the past. And then, in this
kind of weather my teeth are always—”</p>

<p>“For God’s sake,” exclaimed Jolvin aloud, bolting
from the table, stamping indignantly into the hall, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
presently banging the front door behind him, as he left
the house.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong with that long drink?” purred Mrs.
Manton.</p>

<p>“He’s just acting natural,” Stalton said. “I knew he
got out of bed over the foot. He’s had more hard
luck with his uncle’s estate in England, too, and I knew
he’d scoot if I said anything more about teeth.”</p>

<p>“Well, he can tame himself,” Mrs. Manton submitted
calmly. “This is not an institution for the nervous, and
if Jolvin doesn’t like it, he’ll discover that there aren’t
many invitations out to remain.”</p>

<p>“These fits of his are getting more frequent,” Stalton
remarked.</p>

<p>“He’ll have to mix his drinks a little better than that
anyhow,” said the landlady. “Don’t you think so,
Max?”</p>

<p>“It takes all kinds of people to make a world, Gertrude.”
Lee reminded her. “I feel so darned cut up
about my biochemistry, I can’t be expected to give an
unbiased judgment.”</p>

<p>“Poor boy. You’ll get it, all right. When do you
write?”</p>

<p>“This morning.”</p>

<p>Mauney accompanied his friend, whom he began to
address now as Max, down to the university and, after
Lee had disappeared into one of the buildings, stood
thrilled by the spectacle before him. Here, surrounding
the square, reposed the exemplary specimens of
architecture that housed the various faculties. Max, in
leaving, had pointed them out hurriedly—medicine, industrial
science, Methodist theology, the great library,
the convocation hall, the gymnasium, and last, but most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
impressive, the arts building, a solid, reposeful mass, as
sure as learning itself, with its vine-dressed, dull grey
walls of stone, it’s turreted tower, its marvellous gothic
entrance, leading from the common day, past its embellished
arch, into the dim twilight of contemplation. The
square was belted by a gravel road, serving the various
buildings, and was itself divided into eight triangular
lawns by wide cinder paths, crossing from side to side
and from corner to corner. It was a pleasant view,
for the art of the landscapist had relieved the conventionality
of the pattern by maples and ash-trees, distributed
over the lawns, and by clusters of spiræa and
barberry set attractively at the edges of the paths. The
square was nearly deserted, save for one or two students
who sat on the benches reading.</p>

<p>Mauney wished that with the fall opening he could
be ready to enter upon his college course, but, knowing
this to be impossible, turned sadly away, but yet with
burning ambition, to find the tutor whom Max had recommended.
He was discovered in a little office on
College Street, a small, withered individual, almost swallowed
up in the cluttered disorder of his administrative
quarters. His yellow face, creased like old parchment,
bent into a mechanical smile as he listened to
Mauney’s desires. For a moment he fingered the paper-knife
on his desk, then cast a weary look at his young
customer through tarnished silver-rimmed spectacles.</p>

<p>“The matriculation requirements, Mr. Bard,” he said,
in a cultured, but infinitely dreary voice, as if repeating
a stereotyped speech, “are becoming increasingly
onerous. The departments of the University of
Merlton have established rather severe standards for
college entrance, and I fear you will experience disheartening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
difficulties in attempting to gain matriculation
status within the limits of a single winter term.
However, your ambition is indeed commendable and,
with perseverance, combined with extra tutoring, you
may perhaps be able to succeed. The course that I
would recommend”—he reached for a folder and, opening
it, ran his yellow forefinger down its pages—“is
partly a correspondence course, but partly, also, one of
personal supervision, especially in science subjects. The
cost of this course is considerable, but I am glad to be
able to quote an average of sixty per cent. successes
over a period of the last fifteen years. Other preparatory
tutors have not, unfortunately, been able to compete
with these figures. The fees are payable strictly
in advance, and if you decide to embark upon the
course, you are promised the same individual, careful
attention that is given to everyone.”</p>

<p>Mauney questioned nothing, but embarked. He was
almost delirious with happiness over the proceedings,
the enrolment, the purchase of a score of interesting
books which the tutor recommended, and the prospect
of commencing so quickly the life for which he had
longed. His room at seventy-three Franklin Street, next
to Max’s, was soon a student’s den, with its own table, its
own volumes and its easy chairs. His life became a
very pleasant thing, for, with his daily visits to the little
office on College Street, and the diversions of the boarding
house, he found what seemed to him a wealth of
variety. He was astonished at his own contentment
and at the self-sufficient quality in him that scarcely,
if ever, caused him to think of his former home, or to
reflect upon the dearth of relatives in his new existence.
He wrote to his aunt in Scotland, expressing high satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
with his present occupations. He settled down
in the loved quietness of his room, to master the rudiments
of education. Never once did he stop, weary,
for with the sharp appetite of a starved mind, he
thought of nothing but more information, and more.</p>

<p>Max, who had been successful in his supplementary
examination and was now engaged in the fourth year
of his medical course, frequently dropped into Mauney’s
room for a smoke and a chat. Max never spoke about
his own home, and Mauney refrained from questioning
him. The basis of their friendship was something personal
and gloriously indefinite, that neither thought of
analyzing. They felt at home with each other, and
never, from the very beginning of their acquaintance,
did anything disturb this quite unaccountable understanding.
Mauney always felt that there was a hidden
thought at the centre of Max, with which some day he
would be favored, for behind his dark and often weary
eyes great dreams seemed to pass, greater than the
drawl of his clever and sarcastic tongue. He ventured
to think that perhaps Max had drifted into a profession
for which his nature disqualified him, for he naturally
gained the impression that a medical student needed
to be, in one particular sense, a feelingless person, with
certain vulture-like qualities to steel him against the revoltingly
physical aspects of his work. The skull in
Max’s wardrobe, the illustrations in his books—there
were many symbols of the idea. In secret, however,
Max was evidently no materialist, but sought the wide
comfort of philosophic generalities. No one, to be sure,
would suspect it at seventy-three Franklin Street, where
he was known by his smile, but Mauney would catch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the plaintive note in some quiet remark, as when one
evening, in discussing college work in general, he said:</p>

<p>“Wrap up your colleges and throw them in the ocean.
They furnish us a few years of diversion, but after that
there’s life, and, strange to relate, Mauney, my son,
they have not prepared us for that.”</p>

<p>Mauney excused such criticisms of the university on
the basis of a personal warp in Max’s character, forgave
him for what seemed a vandal attitude, and went on
believing more firmly than ever in the light that spread
from the lamp of learning. By its flame, comforted
and inspired, he forgot the passage of time. He failed
to notice the blush of late autumn that swept like a
passion over the trees of the city, scarcely saw their
bare arms raised in supplication to the greying skies,
nor heaven’s response of swift winds carrying fleecy
burdens. Not until the firm banks of snow began to
settle down, smaller and smaller, under the warming
suns of a windy March, and energetic streams of murky
water rushed along the street gutters, did he wake from
his steadfast dream to realize that his term was nearly
over. Then came a sharp bout with the examinations
and at the end of May he stood looking curiously down
at the withered old tutor who was smiling less stiffly,
less professionally, than usual.</p>

<p>“I am pleased to tell you,” he said, “that you have
gained your university entrance standing. Your work
with me in the preliminary subjects has been, to say
the least, good, and it will afford me pleasure to produce
documentary evidence of your success.” He
paused to reach a small certificate from a drawer.
“This,” he continued, handing it to Mauney, “should be
carefully preserved and forwarded to the university in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
making your application for admission thereto, sometime
before September.”</p>

<p>“Thanks.”</p>

<p>“And before you go,” said the tutor, rising stiffly
from his chair, “let me express the pleasure I have
had in overseeing your early academic career. Moreover,
I would be interested to learn what particular
course you contemplate taking at the university.”</p>

<p>This was a new idea to Mauney. He looked at the
instructor for a moment, with a perplexed expression.</p>

<p>“I’m much interested in people,” he said, “and I think
if I could get a course in history it would suit me.”</p>

<p>“Remember,” cautioned the old man, lifting his finger
as if admonishing a wayward son, “history is a culture
course which, from the financial standpoint, leads
you nowhere. It would fit you only for teaching, a
profession which, as I have learned from acrid experience,
is not perfectly appreciated by the public. You
have other courses to choose from, the more practical
ones, as they might be called, such as engineering, law,
medicine.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll have to consider the question,” Mauney
replied.</p>

<p>“Just so. In the meantime, I would be glad to advise
you on any points and to see you, from time to time,
in order to learn of your academic progress.”</p>

<p>There was a light almost of kindness in the wrinkled,
yellow face as he bade him good-bye. Mauney did not
know how seldom that light had been there under similar
circumstances, nor did he know that the affection of
the old tutor was the same kind of affection that he unconsciously
inspired in most of his associates. Burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
with gleeful happiness over his success, he hurried home
to tell Max.</p>

<p>“Well, you old bear!” exclaimed Lee, violently shaking
Mauney’s hand on learning the news. “You couldn’t
have done better. I’m as happy as if I’d done it myself.”</p>

<p>“Behold the hero,” Max said, as they went into supper
together. “He’s just laid ’em all out. Four years’
work in one.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted Mrs. Manton, putting her arms
about Mauney’s neck and kissing him prettily on the
cheek. “I knew you’d do it, Mauney,” she said.</p>

<p>“Maybe you did, Gertrude,” he laughed, trying to
cover his embarrassment, “but I didn’t expect that.
However, don’t think I didn’t like it.”</p>

<p>Even though Mrs. Manton’s impulsive embrace was
decidedly consoling, Mauney nevertheless disliked it.
He felt immediately afterwards that he would increase
his diligence to detect her next time before it was too
late. He accused himself of being perhaps by nature
too cold. But from the evening, some years since, when
he had felt a woman’s hand upon his own, he had disliked
the feeling. A woman’s hand was too soft. It
reminded him unavoidably of a snake, and made him
shiver. This thesis ran through his private thoughts
a good deal. He did not know women. He thought
they were rather pleasant beings at times, but the danger
of having their warm, soft hands suddenly upon him,
inspired an attitude of caution. He felt confident of
managing them in conversation, but confidence flew to
the winds at the approach of hands, or arms, to say
nothing of lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p class="tb">The summer months passed with snail-like tardiness.
Having no place in particular to go, and nothing
in particular to do, he remained in Merlton at his boarding
house, and divided his time between reading and
making excursions on foot, exploring the city. He now
seized his first opportunity to gratify a long desire, and
spent many of his mornings on the river. Max, who
had this time passed his annual examinations without
stars, had gone out west to teach school for the summer,
in order to make enough money to finance his final year
in medicine. The balance of the personnel at the boarding
house remained unchanged, until one morning at
breakfast he learned that Jolvin was about to return to
England. The news came from Stalton, who said he
had been talking to Jolvin the night before.</p>

<p>“Gertrude,” he said, “do you know what’s happened
to that bird? He’s fallen into a big estate—his uncle’s
estate. Why, it’s worth a couple of hundred thousand.
I saw the lawyer’s letter last night. What do you know
about that?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Manton ate in silence for a moment. “Do Jolvin’s
socialistic beliefs prevent him from accepting it?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Not very much!” Stalton replied with sarcastic emphasis.
“And, by the way he was talking last night, he’s
forgiven England for being such a dough-headed outfit.
Why, that fellow came out here two years ago like
an understudy of Columbus. England? Not if he
knew it. And now I’ll bet he gets the first boat home.
Just watch him skidaddle.”</p>

<p>It was not many minutes until Jolvin, the centre of
conversation, came down to breakfast, unusually smart,
his face wreathed in smiles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good morning, people!” he said expansively, with a
very full bow. “Isn’t it a lovely morning? Good-morning
Stalton!”</p>

<p>“How do you do?” said Stalton crisply.</p>

<p>After taking his seat, the Englishman, noticing the
silence of the table, thought perhaps to stir up conversation.</p>

<p>“You know,” he began, glancing at his dish, “these
corn-flakes are really beastly grotesque things. In England
one scarcely sees them. They are, I fancy, an expression
of American commercialism which invades
even the time-honored ritual of breakfast.”</p>

<p>Stalton suddenly dropped his spoon on the table.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m damned,” he said, simply, and once more
took up his spoon, having received a stern look from
Mrs. Manton.</p>

<p>Jolvin appeared not to have heard Stalton’s remark,
but continued, “But, of course, America is too busy to
cook porridge. There is no leisure or time for what
one might call a comfortable dignity.”</p>

<p>“All this don’t jibe very well with what you usually
say about England,” Stalton remarked. “Most of the
time you seemed to hate the word.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” argued Jolvin. “Any criticisms I have
ever made of England were meant most heartily. But
they were criticisms, not blasphemies. If I were indifferent
to England, I should never bother even to criticize.”</p>

<p>“Have it your way, Jolvin,” said Stalton. “But you
were always damning the leisure class. Now you’re
praising them.”</p>

<p>“I still damn them for their faults. Why, then, should
I not praise them for their virtues?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sail right ahead,” invited Stalton. “You’re in good
form this morning. Got me outclassed, that’s a cinch.”</p>

<p>Even without Jolvin the place was still a most unusual
boarding house. Mauney had learned, by this
time, some of its tacitly-established principles. In the
first place Mrs. Manton, at thirty-five, being widowed
as was understood, regarded her house as a master
hobby. Great attention was bestowed upon the furniture,
the rugs and the walls. She wanted her guests
to be comfortable and, to that end, would put herself
about unceasingly. No advertising of vacant rooms was
ever done, for it was better to have an empty room
without a monthly revenue, than a full room with an
unknown, undesirable stranger. Certain standards had
to be satisfied. Mrs. Manton’s boarders had to possess
what she tersely designated as “<i lang="fr">savez</i>.” This meant a
number of things. It meant the faculty of living in
harmony with other boarders, of being informally
polite and not impolitely formal. It meant keeping in
the background all grandiose ideas, but at the same time
indulging in enough conversation to register one’s consciousness.
It meant that one should not comment upon
the doings of others, but at the same time that one
should avoid doing anything to invite comment. It
meant even this, that if one’s breakfast were not placed
before him as quickly as desired, he was expected to go
to the kitchen and get it; or if one’s bed was not made
up, the understanding was that it be made up by oneself.
And finally, of course, that after a few days’ residence
as an introduction, one would notice that the landlady
was to be addressed familiarly as “Gertrude.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Manton preferred men to women boarders. Mrs.
Dixon was permitted because her husband was a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
sort, with funds of information about racing horses and
the track in general. Sadie Grote, a stenographer down
town, was agreeable and sweet, very unselfish and therefore
helpful. Women had often been under consideration.
At one time Mrs. Manton conducted an experiment
by letting the whole top flat to four university
girls. They remained a whole term, but when the last
of their baggage had left the front door in the spring,
Mrs. Manton had turned to Stalton with all the impatience
of a disappointed experimenter.</p>

<p>“Freddie,” she had vowed, “never again! If we ever
have girls, they’ve got to have blood in their veins, not
pasteurized milk. Isn’t it pitiful how that dreadful
disease known as brain-wart seems to get them.”</p>

<p>There was no gainsaying it—eligibility to seventy-three
Franklin Street required unusual, indescribable
qualities. If Mrs. Manton had written down rules of
conduct (which, of course, she never did), and hung
them on the wall, they would have read much as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">“1.—Avoid extremes.</p>

<p class="hanging">“2.—Nourish high-falooting ideas, if you wish, but keep
them under your hat.</p>

<p class="hanging">“3.—Be as happy as you choose, but don’t explode with
nauseous hilarity, since somebody else may be
sad.</p>

<p class="hanging">“4.—Be downcast when you must, but don’t spread your
gloom.</p>

<p class="hanging">“5.—Be erudite, but don’t teach your ideas.</p>

<p class="hanging">“6.—Be chuck-full of anything you choose to be chuck-full
of, but sit on it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p class="hanging">“7.—Remember that seventy-three aims at averages,
prefers neutral tints and the soft pedal.</p>

<p class="hanging">“8.—Don’t effervesce—most of us have passed that
stage.</p>

<p class="hanging">“9.—Don’t criticize—we all have to live.</p>

<p class="hanging">“10.—Live, but don’t plan. To-day was to-morrow, yesterday.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mauney felt unlikely to transgress many of these tacit
rules of conduct. He was quiet enough in disposition
to melt into the quiet shadows of the place, and was
fond enough of the inhabitants to pattern his superficial
manners after theirs. But he well knew that there
was danger of breaking one of the rules. He had not
yet passed the stage referred to in number eight, and
was quite liable to burst forth enthusiastically to some
one. His enthusiasm for his books and the sheer happiness
he obtained from them was dangerously concealed.
It troubled him. He wanted to talk to Max Lee, and
longed for his return. Then, too, the present, though
charming, was so incomplete! The others at the boarding
house truly lived for the present moment, but
Mauney was feeling the great future beating like a
pulse. He was standing like a benighted sailor on the
dark coast, feeling the break of waves he could not distinctly
see, and coveting the dawn when all would be revealed.</p>

</div>

<p>Mauney met Lorna Freeman the first day of college.
He did not know her name at first, but
she impressed him. This was partly because certain
grooves, instituted that day, promised to guide her in
his company for the next four years, brilliant in prospect.
It happened that out of the great University of
Merlton, only two first year students had chosen the
“straight” history course. Many others had elected to
take combined courses of history plus something else or
other, but of the entire academic population of the
first year only two showed the real specialist thirst
for history alone. This meant that they would receive
much that the others would not. They would be inducted
more deeply into the records of human development.
They would be together, a class all by themselves,
at times, penetrating further than the dilettanti,
who stopped with constitutional history of Germany.
For these two out-and-out students there would be interesting
journeys afield.</p>

<p>He faced Lorna Freeman, therefore, with at least
the vague knowledge that they two were the real, serious
history class. They enrolled together with the assistant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
professor of history, Dr. Alfred K. Tanner,
M.A., Ph.D., D.C.L. (and other degrees usually taken
for granted), in his particular upstairs office in one of
the wings of the Arts Building. Miss Freeman had
already submitted her name, just as any other student
might have done, although there were reasons, as shall
be seen, why it was superfluous. There were a score
of students outside Dr. Tanner’s door, waiting to be
enrolled. But they were the part-timers, the non-specialists,
the great unwashed. First attention must be
given to the “straight” students, and Alfred Tanner
had already given his attention to Lorna Freeman, had
waved her to a stiff chair by the mullioned windows,
and was now giving his attention to Mauney.</p>

<p>He was a big, energetic figure, even as he sat behind
his flat-topped desk, with a look of keen awareness
mixed with love of his work. He was grey, and bald,
and hugely present. He leaned forward, gesticulating,
snapping his grey eyes eagerly.</p>

<p>“Your name is what?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Bard.”</p>

<p>“Bard, yes, Bard. What else?” he mumbled, as he
wrote it down.</p>

<p>“Mauney.”</p>

<p>“Mauney, yes; Mauney Bard! I see!” he looked up
to subject Mauney to a severe scrutiny, during which
he was absent-mindedly biting the nail of his little
finger.</p>

<p>“And now, tell me, Mauney Bard,” he said suddenly,
aiming his plump forefinger at his new pupil, “Tell me,
as well as you can—that’s to say offhandedly—tell me
exactly why you elected the straight history course?”</p>

<p>As he waited for an answer, he looked frowningly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
toward the window, rubbed his nose, and held his head
like a musician preparing to judge the quality of a
chord of music.</p>

<p>“I would say the reason is simple enough,” said
Mauney.</p>

<p>“Good,” commended Tanner, hammering the desk
with his fist: “Simple enough? Yes? Good. All right,
Bard; explain that. Tell me exactly why you elected
it?”</p>

<p>“Because,” said Mauney deliberately, “I’ve always
wanted to understand the basic principles of human progress.”</p>

<p>Tanner, still frowning at the window, mumbled in
an absent-minded tone: “‘Basic principles of human
progress.’ Yes; basic principles.” Then, turning suddenly
toward Mauney, he once more aimed his finger
like a pistol at his face, while his voice came out with
great clearness and deliberation: “Good for you.
That’s good, Bard, very good. Now, you will consult
your time-table to find out your classes, and, by the
way, it’s a very small class this year.” He turned toward
the young lady seated by the window.</p>

<p>“Lorna!” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes! Uncle Alfred,” she responded, in a clear voice,
rising and gracefully approaching the desk.</p>

<p>“This is Mauney Bard—Miss Freeman!”</p>

<p>“How do you do,” she said, with a faint smile and a
nod of her head.</p>

<p>As Mauney bowed to her he noticed what clear, blue
eyes looked fearlessly into his—calm, quiet eyes, with
almost a suggestion of challenge. She was in a grey
street costume that clung neatly to her spare, trim
form, and wore a wide-rimmed black hat that sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
smartly upon her blonde hair and emphasized the natural
pallor of her face. Her features were regular—a
straight, refined nose, and thin, pretty lips. Her
hands were extremely white. In different attire she
could have played a part in a tableaux of the vestal
virgins. She gave Mauney the same feeling as he had
often experienced on looking across the meadows in
the white light of a dewy dawn.</p>

<p>“You and Mr. Bard are the class,” laughed Dr. Tanner.
“I hope that a friendship of reasonable rivalry
may exist in the class, at all times, and that we will be
able to find a room somewhere small enough to hold
us.”</p>

<p>“I know a good place, Uncle Alfred,” said Miss Freeman.</p>

<p>“Where, then?”</p>

<p>“In the tower.”</p>

<p>“Well, we shall see, Lorna. We shall see. I don’t
like it myself, but your suggestion merits consideration.
H’m! The tower? Why on earth, my dear child, do
you say the tower?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t in use.”</p>

<p>“No. Neither is the furnace room.”</p>

<p>“But the tower would give one such a philosophical
elevation, just like old Teufelsdrockh in Carlyle’s book.”</p>

<p>“Oh, damn Carlyle!”</p>

<p>“Uncle Alfred!”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Lorna,” he laughed mischievously. “Well—a
place will be found. Now, you two, clear out.
There’s a congregation of pilgrims near by, seeking the
shrine of Magnus Apollo.”</p>

<p>Mauney did not know that the young lady with whom
he walked down the worn stone steps of the history department<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
was the daughter of Professor Freeman of
that same department, whose office they passed on their
way to the square. That was to be learned later. He
only knew that she seemed an exceptionally fine person.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it funny,” he remarked, as they passed through
the long corridor of the Arts Building. “That there
should only be two of us in the class.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think it’s funny,” she said.</p>

<p>“I mean remarkable,” he corrected himself.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a small class, certainly,” she admitted.
“There are few people who elect history as a straight
course in Merlton, I believe. There should be more.
I had wished there would be at least another woman.”</p>

<p>“That would have made it pleasanter for you, Miss
Freeman.”</p>

<p>“Naturally.”</p>

<p>Mauney noticed how little deference her manner contained.
After he had left her at the front entrance and
was on his way home, he wished that she had said:
“Oh, I think we’ll get along all right.” But she had
frankly admitted that another woman in the year would
have made it pleasanter for her. Queer little blaming
thoughts rose up in his mind against her. Then his
thoughts changed. He began to admire her attitude.
She had been absolutely frank. Was that not rather
unusual? Was she not an unusually truthful kind of
girl?</p>

<p>Presently he lost all touch with the argument. His
brain was painting pictures of her, in dignified poses,
representing some abstract idea of virtue. Finally he
checked the images and cursed himself for being such
a susceptible person. Miss Freeman was merely a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
member of the class. Half the class had no right to be
thinking such thoughts of the other half.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Mauney’s first impression of university
life was an impression of a woman, the first woman, in
fact, who ever seriously disturbed his thoughts. That
night he went into Max Lee’s room to have a smoke.
Max was tired after his summer of teaching, and was
viewing the fifth and last year of his course with evident
distaste.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Mauney, my son,” he invited. “There’s
some good cigarettes. I’m glad you’re taking to smokes.
It will make things evener between us. Well, how’s
things?”</p>

<p>“Not bad, Max,” he replied, taking one of the easy
chairs. “I got enrolled to-day, but haven’t seen much
of the university life yet. The assistant professor of
history, Dr. Tanner, is a good fellow. I’m going to
like him. He’s got a big-brotherly sort of way with
him, and I hope he lectures to us. I didn’t see the professor
yet. I suppose he’s too important for a mere
first-year man to meet so soon.”</p>

<p>“How many are in your group?”</p>

<p>“Just two. Myself and a young lady, whom I met
this morning in Tanner’s office. Her name is Freeman—rather
a good-looking person. She and I are apparently
booked up together for a four-years voyage.”</p>

<p>“In that case,” smiled Max, “I hope she’s companionable.”</p>

<p>“Well,” he replied very seriously, “that’s doubtful.
I wish there was another man along—somebody I could
swear at when I felt like it. I’ll make the best of it.
She may be a really fine person. She’s a niece of Tanner’s,
too. When do you start work?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“To-morrow. Fifth year is pretty easy, but I wish
it was over. I’m getting sick of the whole game.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Money, of course.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean you’re short of cash?”</p>

<p>“Sure. It’s going to be tough wiggling to get through
this year,” he admitted. “Do you know, lack of money
is the one, big, damned tragedy of my life?”</p>

<p>“Could I lend you some?” Mauney asked simply.</p>

<p>“Could you—what?” exclaimed Lee, sitting up.
“Have you got money?”</p>

<p>“Some,” admitted Mauney. “I could lend you a few
hundred, if you need it.”</p>

<p>“It’s mighty decent of you, boy,” Max said. “But
I couldn’t accept it.”</p>

<p>“You don’t need to feel that way.”</p>

<p>“But I do nevertheless. No, I couldn’t. That’s all.”</p>

<p>“Will you promise to let me know if you need it,
later?”</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Lee, settling back in his chair
wearily. “I mentioned money only to dismiss the topic.
I have no desire for wealth, and it’s not immediate
needs I’m thinking of. But here I am, fagged, at the
start of my last year. When I get my M.D. I’ll be as
far from making money as I am now. It’s getting
to be an up-hill game, you see? There are certain things
that a fellow wants to do some time before he dies,
and getting married is one of them.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mauney; “I suppose that comes into the
scheme of things.”</p>

<p>“The scheme of nothing!” scoffed Lee. “It simply
gets into your blood when you meet the right woman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“Am I to suppose,” asked Mauney, in a teasing tone,
“that you have met her?”</p>

<p>Lee was silent. His dark eyes were seriously looking
into space, while his cigarette burned slowly between
his fingers. Mauney realized that he had trampled
carelessly on holy ground, but allowed his own
silence to be his only apology.</p>

<p>“We’ve known each other long enough, Mauney, to
understand how things affect us individually. I’ve
never mentioned women to you. But there has been
one, all along—this past year. She’s real. I love her,
but I can’t tell her. She regards me only as a friend,
and I wouldn’t let her know how I feel for anything.”</p>

<p>“You may wonder why I wouldn’t,” he continued.
“Well, it’s like this, I’ve made up my mind to go into
research work next year, if my health remains good,
and that kind of work won’t give me a living, let alone
enable me to marry. She’s a girl who deserves happiness.
Some one else will give it to her—not me.”</p>

<p>“But the future may be brighter than you think,
Max.”</p>

<p>“I’m not a pessimist, Mauney,” he said thoughtfully,
leaning his head away back and closing his eyes. “I
keep up a cheerful front most of the time. But I
know—I simply know that I’ll never marry Freda MacDowell.”</p>

<p>“What is she like, Max?”</p>

<p>“I’ll have you meet her some time. She’s just like
nobody else.”</p>

<p class="tb">The opening days of college dragged slowly for
Mauney. There were broken classes, time-tables not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
yet perfected, initiations and other interfering details.
Then, as if suddenly, the great university wheel quivered
to a start and immediately swung around with remarkable
smoothness and astonishing rapidity. In the
daytime he sat listening to interesting lectures. In the
evenings he lived with his books, deeply absorbed, as
the weeks passed, with the problems of history. The
records of human progress drew him with a warm,
romantic attraction, for his imagination filled in the
gaps that make history different from story. Characters
became real and living. He rose and fell in sympathy
with the dim fortunes of forgotten men. The
formal page, with its caption and its paragraphs, faded
into invisibility, leaving a glowing passage of actual
life in which he brought himself temporarily to live.</p>

<p>It was very engrossing. Lorna Freeman found it
so, too. She grew somewhat more friendly as the weeks
passed, and by mid-term she would talk volubly with
Mauney on historical subjects. He found her mind
to be an acutely exacting one. It surprised him at
first to discover such a mind in a woman. He thought
her mental powers exceeded his own, because she
could nearly always trip him up in an argument, a
thing which she habitually did without exultation, but
just methodically, as if tripping him up were part of
her natural occupation. One day he learned that her
father was Professor Robert Freeman, the seldom-seen
head of the department. Mauney only saw him
once, as he was pointed out walking thoughtfully
through the corridors, a small, shrewd-appearing man,
with grey eyes and a fixed smile.</p>

<p>History was absorbing, but our young hero was finding
himself a good deal in thought about Lorna Freeman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Not once had he ever said a thing even faintly
familiar. One Monday morning, however, the temptation
became unduly strong. Miss Freeman was seated
in the seminary room by the long table, waiting for
Dr. Tanner to take the class. It was winter, and her
fur coat was laid neatly over the back of an empty
chair. She never removed her hat, a prerogative gained
from the intimate size of the class. As Mauney entered
the room she looked up from a book and nodded.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” he said, as he took a chair at
the opposite side of the table. The large Gothic window
at the front of the room commanded a view of the
square, busy with students hurrying in various directions
to their lectures. Dr. Tanner was late. They
sat for fully a quarter of an hour, she quietly reading,
Mauney stealing occasional glances at her pensive face.
He tried to categorize Lorna Freeman, but could not.
She did not fit into any types existent in his mind.
She was definitely unusual. She attracted him on this
account. There was also about her a certain queenliness.
Why had they never once found anything to talk
about except their work?</p>

<p>“I guess Dr. Tanner has been waylaid,” he ventured
at length.</p>

<p>“He’s usually so punctual, too,” she replied, and then
continued reading.</p>

<p>“Do you ever get tired of studying?” he went on,
determined to sound her.</p>

<p>“Well, naturally. Don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do. I suppose if there was another man
in the class I wouldn’t mind it so much.”</p>

<p>She glanced quickly up.</p>

<p>“Mind what, Mr. Bard?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, you see, Miss Freeman, perhaps there’s something
else in life besides continual study. I’d like to
have somebody to chew the rag with, once in a blue
moon.”</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether I’m qualified for chewing the
rag or not,” she said slowly. “What does the process
signify?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just being sort of human, once in a while.”
There was a savor of mild cautery in his tone that
did not fail to reach his fair companion.</p>

<p>“And what, pray, does being human mean?” she inquired.</p>

<p>“Personal, I imagine. It means cutting down this
constant barrier you keep up.”</p>

<p>Her eyebrows lowered into a delicate frown, while
her calm, blue eyes took on an expression half-way
between surprise and displeasure. Then her pale face
blushed.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Bard, I hardly understand!” she began.
“I—”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” he interrupted. “You mustn’t be offended.
That’s the last idea in my head. If I didn’t
care at all I wouldn’t have mentioned it.”</p>

<p>He rose from the table and walked slowly, to stand
by the great window. Her eyes followed his big form,
and then rested on the back of his auburn head. She
was not only puzzled, but even confused. After a hesitant
moment she rose very slowly and then walked
quickly to his side.</p>

<p>She touched him on the arm and looked up into
his face.</p>

<p>“Oh, tell me,” she said with some distress, “have I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
done anything to hurt your feelings? You’re such a
genuine sort of a man, I really wouldn’t want to hurt
your feelings.”</p>

<p>Mauney’s blue eyes opened wide with surprise. He
saw such child-like simplicity in her face that he smiled
with admiration. He knew, just then, that he could
have surrounded her shoulders with both his arms.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” he said. “You’ve got me trimmed a mile
for brains. That’s the whole trouble.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Brains! You seem to have more of them than I
have.”</p>

<p>She frowned and glanced at his mouth.</p>

<p>“Well, does one usually say that, even if one thinks
so?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he answered seriously. “I said it
because it’s so, and because it’s just your brains that
keep you from treating me humanly.”</p>

<p>“Oh—you mean chewing the rag?”</p>

<p>“Sure. You see, I don’t know how to act with you.
We’re always together and I think it would be better
to be a little more informal.”</p>

<p>She placed the end of her fountain pen against her
lips, pensively.</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s!” she suddenly exclaimed. “That would be
so nice, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“You see,” he said, glancing toward the great square,
“the trouble has been that I didn’t know whether you
had any heart or not. You have just been a sort of
disembodied intelligence.”</p>

<p>“Now, listen,” she said, with a look of mild reproach.
“I’m sorry if I’ve made things unpleasant. As you say,
it would be better if there was another man in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
class. But there isn’t likely to be. So, consequently,
we will have to hit upon a reasonable <i lang="la">modus vivendi</i>.
I think it’s really awfully nice of you to be so frank.
But, really, I don’t quite understand what’s wrong. I
have always just been natural, I think.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. But we never took time to get acquainted,”
he explained. “I know what you think about
the secession of the plebs, but I have no idea what you
think about Tanner, or me, or music, or friendship. I
don’t know what your hobbies are, or what you think
about in your spare time. I’d like to talk over these
things if you ever find time.”</p>

<p>“That’s fine. Why shouldn’t we? Will you come
over to my house for tea some day?”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“Why—any time. Say to-morrow?”</p>

<p>It was agreed.</p>

<p>The tea at Freeman’s was over.</p>

<p>Mauney was sitting in Max Lee’s room after supper.
These evening chats had become almost necessary.
There was a time when they could both digest their
evening meals downstairs in the dining-room in conversation
with the rest. But now they neither felt ready
to settle down to their studies without brief exchange
of ideas and impressions.</p>

<p>“Anything new, my son?”</p>

<p>“Very new,” admitted Mauney, lighting a cigarette.
“Sit down, Max. I’m going to tell you about the
Freeman’s.”</p>

<p>“The young lady, Lorna, I suppose,” drawled Lee, as
he sprawled in one of the easy chairs. “Women are
always an interesting matter to me. And you’re a
popular devil with women, too—”</p>

<p>“Hold on—”</p>

<p>“True. Only they all wonder. They all wonder at
you.”</p>

<p>“At me?”</p>

<p>“Correct. You have a woman-hating nature. You
don’t warm up to women very much. That acts as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
challenge and keeps them coming. Do you do that on
purpose?”</p>

<p>“I don’t hate ’em, boy,” he contradicted. “But I find
they are very uncertain beings. Take this Freeman
girl. Why, you’d travel fifteen days before you’d find
another brain like hers, Max. She’s like a steel-trap
with the real snap to it. If she doesn’t quite ‘savez’
what you’re talking about, she lights right into your
remark, like an expert surgeon with a knife, and dissects
it down to the heart. Then, having established
your meaning, she frames her reply with the greatest
care.... My God!”</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>

<p>“You’d think she was being interviewed by a reporter.
She’s so precise about giving you her real, unbiased,
judicial opinion. Whew! That brain of hers! It’s
wonderful, wonderful. I wish I had her brains, Max.
A memory like a photograph album. Just turn it up,
see? A judgment as deft as Solomon’s—a good judgment—nothing
leaks out of it—every point receives
due weight. She’s different. She speaks differently
from most people. You never know what she’s going
to say. In fact, you can be sure she won’t say what
any other girl would say. Suppose you were to ask
an average girl how she likes playing cards, what would
you expect her to say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, she might say ‘I adore cards,’ or ‘I’m not especially
keen,’ or ‘I’d like to play them with you in a
cosy nook,’ and so forth, <i lang="la">ad nauseam</i>.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’d never guess what she said. I asked her
if she liked cards. She said, ‘That all depends on the
cards. If they’re very new and slippery, I could sit
for hours sliding them through my fingers; but if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
stick the least bit they make me shiver.’ That’s only
one example. I asked her what her aim in life was.”</p>

<p>“You did?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You impertinent rascal! Nobody does that.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Nobody has any aim in life—we just drift. Well,
what did she say?”</p>

<p>“She sat back in her chair, smiling as if she enjoyed
trying to figure it out. Then she said, ‘Oh, Mr. Bard,
did you ever listen to a violin until you were entranced?’
I admitted that I had, at times, done so. ‘Well!’ she
said, ‘that’s just it. I want to make my life just like a
beautiful strain of music.’ Now what do you think
of that, Max?”</p>

<p>Lee frowned. “Frothy stuff to me. Unreal, hyper-imaginative,
away off the trail, anæmic and supermellifluous.”</p>

<p>Mauney laughed.</p>

<p>“You should have taken up writing,” he said. “Queer
family, these Freemans. I never met nor ever heard
of anybody a bit like them. The professor is as gentle
as a woman, but he gives you a feeling like a storm
brewing. It’s hard to express. He’s courteous, refined,
and pleasant, but he’s diabolically clever. We
haven’t had any lectures from him yet. He was up in
his study at home, slaying a book. She introduced me.
He couldn’t have been nicer, and yet—well, damn it—you
can’t get hold of him. He’s like the ivory playing
cards. He slips through your fingers. You think
you’ve got him, and just then you notice that he’s miles
ahead of you.”</p>

<p>Mauney then shook with sudden laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?” Max said, glaring
at him. “Been having a tooth extracted under gas?”</p>

<p>“No. But, I don’t get that family at all. There’s
Mrs. Freeman, too. She’s like a velvet comforter laid
softly about your soul. Her voice is like velvet. She’s
more genuine, I’d wager, than her husband. But—oh,
Lord!—there’s some tragedy. Such an endless, engulfing
tragedy; so big and endless that she has developed
a kind of martyr attitude. She’s like a Sister of the
Perpetual Adoration, suddenly required to do penance
by living a civil life.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet the tragedy is her husband!” said Max,
with a tone of certitude.</p>

<p>“Maybe it is. Well, Lorna’s an only child. A queer
girl; never met anybody like her, and—”</p>

<p>“You seem quite interested, though, don’t you, my
son?”</p>

<p>“Well, she’s beautiful, Max.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that changes the situation. More power to your
elbow. But wait.” His black eyes wandered casually
over Mauney’s open features and a smile stole over his
lips. “Do you know, you’re liable to fall for her.”</p>

<p>“I know it. I’ve fallen already,” Mauney admitted.
“I’m in hot water. I want to be near her. She’s like
an Easter lily. I want to—to pick that lily.”</p>

<p>A man never knows his capacity for action along
any line until put to the test. Mauney, burdened with
trying to find himself in many ways, received the added
burden of a woman’s attraction. It was all new
to him. Never before had it happened. Here was
Lorna Freeman, fresh as the lily to which he had referred,
with him every day of the week except Sunday.
Even the Sabbath began to hold her, too, for she accepted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
his invitations to stroll out Riverton way. There
were long reaches of broad, board walks stretched beside
the river where they perambulated, just like less
sophisticated clerks and stenographers, who also found
Riverton good. The Freemans never had a motor-car.
Mauney did not realize that he had money enough to
buy one. Consequently their feet took them wherever
they went. Long strolls on Sunday, during which they
got away from history entirely! In fact nothing could
be farther removed from history. The vivid present
swelled up before him so gigantically that he had trouble
sticking to his books.</p>

<p>He wanted to say something to Lorna, but kept putting
it off, partly because he was uncertain as to the
thing itself, and partly because more preparation
seemed necessary. He found that he could keep on
looking at her for hours, but that, on attempting to describe
his feelings, he was overtaken by a sense of diffidence.
Would she quite understand him?</p>

<p>He was on the third term time-table now. Christmas
and Easter were past. Spring and the prospect
of examinations were at hand. There came languorous
evenings. The precincts of his bedroom grew tiresome.
April moved the lace curtains inside his open
window. He got up from his desk and stretched himself
and went straight to Freeman’s, on Crandall Street,
and asked if Lorna was at home. She was out, but
was expected home soon, and he was invited to wait
for her. Perhaps, Mrs. Freeman suggested, he would
like to go up with the professor until she came back.</p>

<p>“Of course you know where to find him,” she said,
with a soft gesture toward the staircase. “Up in his
study. Always, always studying, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>He thanked her and went up. He had been up once
or twice before with Lorna, indulging in very deep
talk. Moral philosophy, ethics, conceptions of history!
Very pleasant occasions, to be sure, but equally as
strange as Freeman himself. Now, to be alone with
the head of the department! The study door was
closed and he knocked.</p>

<p>“Come,” called the professor.</p>

<p>As he entered he beheld the historian, lounging in
a deep Morris chair before a grate fire, with an open
book on his knees.</p>

<p>“Well, Mauney,” he said pleasantly, as he rose.
“Won’t you sit down?”</p>

<p>Professor Robert Freeman was such a mite of a
man that Mauney wondered how he had managed to
brave the storm of life for fifty years. Whenever he
saw him he felt like saying: “Well, professor, I expected,
before seeing you again, to hear of your funeral.
I expected you’d pick up a pneumonia germ somewhere
and pass out.”</p>

<p>Mauney would know him better later on, for the biological
tragedy entailed in a struggle between germs
and this frail body had been given as careful consideration
by its owner as almost everything else, and, arguing
that continued existence depended either on keeping
up a strong physical resistance or else on avoiding
germs altogether, Freeman chose to pursue the latter
policy. His cunning brain saved him. He never rode
on street cars. He avoided funerals, theatres and
churches. “Germs? Why, don’t get them. That’s all!”</p>

<p>Freeman’s long, thin face, with its grey eyes trained
upon the world like vigilant sentinels, smiled perpetually.
His nearly-bald pate sported a little patch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
thin, grey hair, parted carefully in the centre. But
that smile! It was, in a sense, all of Freeman.</p>

<p>“What kind of smile, in reality, is it?” thought
Mauney.</p>

<p>Never a happy smile, though at times it betokened delight.
Never a suspicious smile, though it frequently
indicated deep-buried fires of irony that could not be
given full scope. Usually it was a polite, deferential
grimace, that suggested Voltaire ever so slightly. So
far from being repulsive, it put Mauney immediately
at ease. Its social value was its hospitality, an almost
pitying hospitality, as if the professor was pleased
enough to have intercourse with others of the same
biological species, seeing what a mess life was for all
of them.</p>

<p>“That’s exactly it,” soliloquized Mauney. “That unpleasant,
insuperable, unavoidable mess—human life.
It’s his stock-in-trade.”</p>

<p>The man’s erudition was profound. He had wracked
his brains energetically on every department of thought,
from religion to geology, and back again several dozens
of times, looking for just one peep-hole of light and
hope. The tragedy was that not one peep-hole had been
found. Philosophy, logic, ethics, comparative theology,
political economy, history of all kinds, literatures of
all nationalities—he had dissected them all, pruned
them all, reduced them all to their elemental fallacies,
and there the matter stood.</p>

<p>“Mauney,” he had said during one of their discussions,
“you can’t be sure of anything. You can prove
nothing. Why? Simply because, in any conclusion at
which you arrive, you can never be sure of your
premises.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Just why the uncertainty of one’s premises should so
rob life of its many enthusiasms, Mauney could not understand.
At heart he never enjoyed talking with Freeman,
for, although he admired his adroit intellect, the
professor always left him temporarily transfixed on
the horns of a logical dilemma, or else temporarily
treed by a savage, snarling premise. But as a mental
exercise it was great fun, and its depressing effects
yielded to fresh air as an antidote.</p>

<p>At any rate Robert Freeman was a great man. His
opinion on historical questions was a high court of appeal.
His monumental work on the constitutional history
of France was on the shelf of every self-respecting
library in the country. It was an honor to have
access to the great man’s home. “Freeman on Constitutional
History” was a familiar marginal reference in
text books. Freeman, alone in his library, with a big
pipe and a huge, red can of tobacco beside him on
the table, was a privilege. With almost reverent eyes
Mauney looked upon the man who held the chair of history
in the renowned University of Merlton—Merlton,
that light set upon the summit of the world for the
world’s illumination, that arch-planter of wisdom’s
germs, that spring of the river of knowledge. And
Freeman, that inextinguishable flame, whose brilliant
radiance shone abroad—here he sat, smiling, smoking,
conversing.</p>

<p>“I hope I’m not taking your time, Professor,” he
apologized.</p>

<p>“No, I’m just reading a light thing,” he said, indicating
his book. “You know I read everything, Mauney.
I’m like a butterfly—taking a little honey from this
flower and a little from that!” His long fingers turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
lightly through the pages. Mauney observed them—those
long fingers, those restless hands of Freeman’s,
those long, thin hands like a woman’s, that were always
twining themselves about some object. If they were
ever still it must have been during sleep, but even then
Mauney could more easily fancy them moving sinuously
about the folds of his counterpane. They were like his
mind. If they held a book before his eyes they kept
feeling the covers, as if his brain, in its intent of complete
mastery, took cognizance even of the texture of
the binding.</p>

<p>“And I find,” continued Freeman, “that it’s wise to
read light, little things like this. You know, enjoyment
is everything.”</p>

<p>“But is it?” ventured Mauney, consciously drifting
into the familiar channel of their arguments. “Is enjoyment
really everything?”</p>

<p>Freeman’s face became delicately ethereal as he considered
the question.</p>

<p>“I think so,” he said softly. “But if you are in any
doubt, please begin by stating your own opinion, will
you not?”</p>

<p>For a moment Mauney smoked in silence, reminded
of Socrates.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he consented. “Now I think that enjoyment
is comparatively incidental. A man has a duty to perform
in the world, and he must perform it whether he
enjoys doing so or not.”</p>

<p>“All right, Mauney,” smiled Freeman. “But won’t
you admit that the motive that empowers you to perform
your duty is the prospect of future enjoyment in
seeing your task completed?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“That, professor, is equivalent to saying that all effort
is inspired by the hope of getting a thrill.”</p>

<p>“Well, isn’t it true? We are selfish at all times. We
want the thrill. I don’t care where you take it. It’s
the same principle everywhere. Socrates drank hemlock
because it thrilled him to think he was abiding
by the legal decision of his country. And even of Jesus
Christ it is written: ‘For the joy that was set before
him he endured the cross.’”</p>

<p>This last example came as a jolt to Mauney’s being.
His thoughts drifted. There was a long pause before
they resumed conversation. For an hour they continued.
To whatever argument they turned—and they
turned to several—Mauney felt that, while he was consistently
defeated in a superficial sense, he was victorious
in a deeper sense that Freeman could not, or would
not, grasp. As in their previous conversations, they
eventually arrived at the blind, stone wall of nullity,
where Freeman’s declared position was one of absolute
mental helplessness, and Mauney’s one of undeclared
boredom and impatience.</p>

<p>When at last he heard Lorna playing downstairs, he
rose and took leave of the professor.</p>

<p>Why had he come so eagerly to-night? The question
forced him to pause on the lower steps of the staircase.
In the drawing-room he saw her seated by the
piano. The riddle of his attraction faded out of his
thoughts as he leaned on the banister to watch and
listen. She was absorbed in the skilful rendering of a
scale-infested classic. Although her hands, like racing
elves, flew with dexterous speed upon the ivory keys,
her body was reposefully still, her chin slightly lifted,
her eyes viewing the performance like impartial critics.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
When she finished, quite unconscious of Mauney’s
presence, and picked up her kerchief from the music
holder to rub her hands, he remained on the steps spell-bound
with admiration. Then she turned her head and,
as she saw him, rose gracefully, but with much coloring
of her face.</p>

<p>“I didn’t want to interrupt,” he explained, as he came
near her. “What is that?”</p>

<p>She told him the name of the selection.</p>

<p>“It’s quite difficult, Mauney. Not very entertaining,
either. I fear it will be some time before I venture to
exhibit it.” She looked up with a serious, accusing
glance. “You took a very unfair advantage of me,
didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“How, Lorna?” he asked in surprise.</p>

<p>Then he realized what she meant. Queer frankness!
Queer bashfulness! Did she ever think anything without
saying it? Did she ever withhold a criticism?</p>

<p>“Why, no,” he said, “I—I didn’t mean to be—rude,
you know. Aren’t you a strange girl?”</p>

<p>“What will I play for you?” she asked, turning
through some sheets of music. “Do you like this?”</p>

<p>She held up Nevin’s “Day in Venice.”</p>

<p>“Um—h’m,” he nodded. “That’s wonderful!” He had
never heard it in his life. He was looking into her
blue eyes above the sheet of music. “Don’t you think
so, Lorna?”</p>

<p>“What are you staring at?”</p>

<p>“Was I staring? Forgive me.”</p>

<p>As she began the piece he lounged in a chair near by.
Nevin’s dream, in all its pretty moods, all its imagery!
He half-listened. He wanted to think.</p>

<p>The Freeman home was growing comfortable. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
its members were, no doubt, off the beaten path. Mauney
felt a commendation in their very originality. If the
professor chose to spend his time in the desultory travail
of mental investigations, was not his occupation as
justifiable as the time-wasting hobbies of most men?
If Mrs. Freeman wished to limit her mind, as she apparently
did, to devotional pursuits, was this any more
to be criticized than the asininity of bridge-parties and
the hypocritical commitments of woman’s average
social life? And if, finally, Lorna chose to be so uncomfortably
frank as to inform him how little she relished
eaves-dropping over a banister, was her frankness not,
in reality, part of a truthful, clean-cut personality, that
admitted no deception? The home was growing comfortable.</p>

<p>But he did not know what he wanted to say to Lorna.
Their conversation roamed aimlessly and pleasantly
along accustomed paths. He found himself admiring
her queenly face and groping for words. After an hour
the professor’s soft step was heard on the stairs. He
came in, to find them sitting in separate chairs, five feet
apart. He smiled and glanced from one to the other.</p>

<p>“Well, people,” he said, in his quiet voice, “what
is the big topic of discussion to-night?”</p>

<p>“We haven’t struck one yet, sir,” Mauney replied.
“We’ve been avoiding controversial subjects.”</p>

<p>“Would you like some tea?” Freeman asked.</p>

<p>This was the historian’s failing—tea at night, hot,
weak and in quantities, before he retired to the midnight
vigil of his more serious study. Lorna led the
way to the dining-room and made it. Holding their cups
and saucers they stood talking about art for art’s sake.
This was introduced by a still-life group in oils, hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
over the sideboard, and completed, at length, by an appeal
to the professor, who stated that, without any
shadow of doubt, art had no higher aim than art. But
while he talked he looked from one to the other, as
if, in the undercurrents of his brain, he was attempting
to decide how intimate a relationship existed between
them, and as if, so Mauney felt, he himself
would be the greatest obstacle to any suitor for his
daughter’s hand.</p>

<p>Later Lorna bade Mauney good-night in the vestibule,
between the hall-door and the street-door. Some
sense of being closeted from the world stole upon him
and with it a desire to take Lorna passionately in his
arms. With an effort he checked the impulse.</p>

<p>“Lorna,” he said, “do you know that I nearly kissed
you. What would you have done?” He still held her
hand.</p>

<p>“I suppose I should have shivered and been angry!”
she replied, simply.</p>

<p>“Then,” he said, giving her hand a little pat, “aren’t
you glad I didn’t?”</p>

<p>“Naturally.”</p>

<p>From her complacent tone he might have been asking
the question, “Do you prefer wealth to poverty?”</p>

<p>Mauney soon realized that, unsatisfactory as was the
progress of his affair with Lorna Freeman, he was gaining
some advantages from his connection with the
family. Life was now a very different thing from
that of Lantern Marsh farm. He had at last arrived
into the midst of education. He had found people who
knew things and were willing to teach him out of their
knowledge. Moreover, he could discern that he was
being gradually adopted by the Freemans. Through
their influence he received an invitation to a dinner at
the home of François de Freville. It was written in
French. It was to be, for him, a most unusual pleasure
and a very exciting one. He had a tailor measure
him for a dinner-jacket suit. Lorna fell in love with
it, when she saw it, on the evening of the function at
de Freville’s. They met at Freeman’s and walked up
Crandall Street behind the professor and his wife.</p>

<p>François de Freville, the popular professor of
French, always entertained charmingly. He could not
do it in any other way. This was a “Faculty dinner,”
all the guests being members of the university staff,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
with a few exceptions, as in Mauney’s case. As a
matter of fact it was a rare privilege to be invited and
to meet personally the brilliant men who, on such an
occasion, put off the garments of their wonted academic
restraint, to indulge in free, good-fellowship.
François himself lent a distinctly exotic atmosphere.
With delightful informality he stood butler inside his
own street door, and roared greetings to the guests as
they arrived. He was a giant who must bow his head
on entering doorways to avoid striking his skull—a man
of unusual stature, big-bodied, big-handed, big-headed.
Perhaps the charm of being received tempestuously by
François lay in the ludicrous idea that this herculean
host need not necessarily receive anyone, for if a party
of armed militia presented themselves demanding reception
they would certainly never get in. François,
standing with his big, red face, his enormous black
eye-brows, his enormous smile, that burst forth from
lairs of brows and black moustaches, would hurl back
invasion with smiling ease. In every detail of appearance
he suggested the strong-sinewed “kicker-out” of
the continental restaurant—just as brusque, just as impulsive,
just as toweringly imposing. It was his perversion
of function that titillated the fancy, for he was
welcoming his guests. One by one he received them,
with a fitting word for each, a word of liberty, in fact,
which only François would be permitted, of all men,
to speak.</p>

<p>“Ah! Madame Freeman!” he took her hand, as she
entered, between his own enormous hands to pet it.
“Vous êtes très charmante ce soir!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Freeman was not charming to-night. She was
never charming, being always too instinct with the soft,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
great mystery of her personal tragedy. That, however,
was quite immaterial. Even if, after thirty years of
married life, only dim relics of charm had survived,
there was still a truant delight in being told this falsehood.
Mauney saw her warm to the salutation of
François, and manage to get past his great bulk in excellent
spirits.</p>

<p>“Ah, M’sieur le Professeur!” bellowed the giant as
he greeted Freeman. What a contrast the two men
formed! Freeman smiled apprehensively at the pile
of vibrant life before him, as if dreading the forthcoming
<i lang="fr">bon mot</i>.</p>

<p>“Le grand homme, mes amis,” François vociferously
announced to a cluster of guests in the drawing-room.
“Le grand homme est arrivé!”</p>

<p>The laughter which greeted this announcement was
restrained because, apparently, the guests felt that Freeman
actually was a great man.</p>

<p>“Bon soir, Mam’selle,” to Lorna.</p>

<p>“Bon soir, M’sieur Bard. Vous êtes bienvenue.”</p>

<p>The host still stood at his post, when Mauney wandered,
a few minutes later, through the hallway, and
beheld him welcoming a new arrival. Mauney was impressed
with the new arrival’s appearance. A woman
of perhaps twenty-two, and of bewitching beauty, she
stood, her hand still grasped by the Frenchman and
laughing at his words.</p>

<p>“Bon soir, bon soir, Oiseau!” burst forth François
and bent to kiss her hand with perfect gallantry. “Bienvenue,
ma petite Oiseau, la maison est à toi!”</p>

<p>Mauney wondered at the nickname. Perhaps her
movements, her manner, as lightsome as a bird’s, had
suggested it, or perhaps the plaintive alto note of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
voice made François think—as it did Mauney—of treetops
on summer evenings. She stood for a moment
looking up with admiration into her host’s eyes.</p>

<p>“I don’t know the French for it,” she laughed, “but
if your house is Oiseau’s it’s a roost, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Thereat de Freville roared, and, holding his sides,
watched Oiseau’s neat ankles (as did Mauney also)
while she climbed the staircase to remove her cloak.</p>

<p>While the guests waited for dinner, they talked in
several groups about the hall and the tastefully arranged
drawing-room. De Freville found Mauney
standing alone and introduced him to “Oiseau.” Mauney
had difficulty understanding the Professor’s French,
his only admitted language, but managed to draw from
his explosive encomium, that Miss MacDowell was in
some way or other an exceptional person in the University
of Merlton. When François left them she
laughed with amusement, turning from his hulk of a
figure to her new acquaintance.</p>

<p>“Have you known the professor long, Mr. Bard?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Just met him to-night. A good sort, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, remarkable,” she said. “His robust voice always
makes me think of somebody yelling into an empty rain
barrel.”</p>

<p>Miss MacDowell was a decided brunette, with very
beautiful dark brown eyes that permitted themselves to
be looked into. Mauney at once felt depth after depth
revealing themselves as he looked—comforting eyes,
that seemed as much alive as the rest of her oval face.
She gained strength from her arched nose, and tenderness
from her delicate lips. Her upper lip drew up at
times, exposing a white gleam of teeth. There was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
unusual sympathy about her upper lip. It drew up with
delicate quiverings as if attuning itself to catch his
mood. Her black hair and brows, together with her
youthful color, completed the outward appearance of
a woman in whom he became immediately interested.</p>

<p>“Do you attend the university?” he ventured.</p>

<p>“Yes. It’s a habit,” she laughed. “Three years of
it.”</p>

<p>“What line are you especially interested in, Miss
MacDowell?”</p>

<p>“None, Mr. Bard. I didn’t come to college to get
an education.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! Why, then, did you come, may I ask?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just to get enough highbrow information so
that I would know what highbrows were talking about.”
She said this quite seriously, with a note of unexpected
bitterness in her voice. “If there’s one cruel advantage
one person ever takes of another it’s to talk about
something of which the other person knows nothing.
If I hadn’t come to the university, then, no matter
where I went, any girl who had waded through Horace,
or physics, or solid geometry, could make me shrivel
into insignificance by mentioning ‘O fons Bandusiæ,’
or Boyle’s law or conic sections. As it stands now I
know a Latin poem by its sound. I know that a law in
physics isn’t essential to individual happiness, and that
conic sections (so far as I’m concerned) are nothing
but an inconsiderate imposition.”</p>

<p>Mauney laughed and drew up a couple of chairs.</p>

<p>“Now, for argument’s sake,” he said, when they were
seated—“mathematics is great. It’s wonderful to know
that there is an eternal principle of fitness governing
problems of numbers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“It may be wonderful enough,” she conceded, leaning
over the arm of her chair, “but to dwell on it
would take the pastoral quality clean out of life for me.
I’m lacking in appreciation of such marvels. I’m interested
in folks—just folks. I want to know how they
feel. I want to understand folks.”</p>

<p>Mauney was somewhat put to it to gauge the strong
individualistic note in Miss MacDowell, but was determined
to try still harder.</p>

<p>“Do you believe in woman suffrage?” he ventured.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“Surely,” he said, “you believe in women’s rights.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” replied Miss MacDowell, calmly.
“We are the weaker sex. God made us weak on purpose.”</p>

<p>“Never!” argued Mauney, although he liked her attitude.
“That’s an old bogy that got a fatal foothold
in antediluvian days, and it’s taken about fifty centuries
to get the idea even questioned. Ask any woman.
She’ll tell you that the greatest movement of the twentieth
century is the emancipation of women!”</p>

<p>“Tell me,” she said, pointedly, “from what do women
seek to be emancipated?”</p>

<p>“Why! from an inferior rating. Woman’s intelligence
and her equality demand a better label than man’s
helpmeet.”</p>

<p>She cast a shrewd glance at Mauney, as if doubting
his sincerity.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you a bit of a bluffer?” she asked. “Well,
listen; you’re off the track. Woman’s inherent weakness
is the very secret of her strength. Take any man,
no matter how stubbornly masculine, and there’s a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
woman somewhere who can just simply make or mar
him.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” queried Mauney, looking more
deeply into her pretty, dark eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, if you don’t believe me, open your eyes and
look at life!”</p>

<p>Mauney enjoyed her mild exasperation and determined
to extract her viewpoint still further. There was
as yet no sign of dinner, and the score of guests still
kept up a monotonous buzz of conversation. He
noticed Lorna talking with Mr. Nutbrown Hennigar,
a lecturer in the history department.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think men are irrational beings, Miss
MacDowell?” he said, turning his chair a little toward
her.</p>

<p>“What difference does that make?”</p>

<p>“You might have more respect for them if they
weren’t!”</p>

<p>“Respect men!” she laughed. “Why I think they’re
just wonderful. I just love men. But, tell me, Mr.
Bard, what are you taking at the university?”</p>

<p>“History.”</p>

<p>“Like it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. What are you taking?”</p>

<p>“General course.”</p>

<p>“Like it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, please don’t ask me!” she implored, playfully
putting up her slender hands in mock impatience. “The
college game never quite phizzed on me, I’m afraid. I’m
tired of it. May as well tell the truth, as lie about it,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Surely. But what is it you dislike about education?”</p>

<p>“Education’s all right. It’s the university. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
day I’m going to write a book on how to run one’s university—just
like a hand-guide on how to run one’s
automobile. I’ll send you a copy, if I don’t forget.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t. I imagine it would be hot stuff.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. I take that as a compliment, whether it
is or not.” She laughed as she turned toward the other
guests. “There’s Nutbrown Hennigar over yonder
talking with Lorna Freeman. He’d murder me if he
heard me talk about college this way. You know him
of course. Funny chap. Likeable in many ways. And
he’s certainly in the swim.”</p>

<p>“Swim—how?”</p>

<p>“Why! His father owns the university—Senator
Hennigar, yonder, talking with Madame de Freville.
He looks like cupid at seventy, minus the wings.”</p>

<p>“He’s the Chancellor, isn’t he?” Mauney asked. “I’m
just a green-horn in Merlton. I’m afraid of my shadow
at an affair like this.”</p>

<p>“Chancellor—yes—and then some! You certainly
are green if you don’t know all about the Hennigars.
However, you’ll learn, Mr. Bard. Hennigar is the
great password. You can do anything if you have a
little bit of Hennigar. There’s Nutbrown, for example,
lecturing in history. Someday he’ll be the professor.
There’s Professor Freeman, married to Hennigar’s
daughter.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Mauney, suddenly sitting up in astonishment.</p>

<p>“But, yes,” quoth Miss MacDowell in surprise.
“Didn’t you know that?”</p>

<p>“I certainly did not.”</p>

<p>“Well, how much will I tell you? Who are your
friends here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Freemans.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad,” she sighed playfully. “My tongue
will get me in wrong, sooner or later.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. Shoot ahead. I’m very keen on what
you’re telling me.”</p>

<p>“In that case I’ll continue. Professor Freeman is a
brilliant man, but, without a little bit of Hennigar, his
brilliance would have been doomed to obscurity like the
jewel in the cave. He started life as poor as a church
mouse, but saw help in two directions. I know him
like a book. He got a job as lecturer in history. He
stuck to business and avoided individualistic tendencies.
I give him great credit. He knew that since the days
when Socrates held tutorial groups in porches down to
the present when he held his own in university halls,
a fair volume of knowledge had been amassed—quite
enough historical data to engage anyone comfortably.
He had opinions of his own, but ascension on the
academic ladder meant consistent self-suppression. He
quietly taught the young idea old ideas, and rose in
favor, until, gradually passing through assistant-ships
and associate-ships, he stretched out finally in the chair
of history. But, of course, the magic behind it all was
his connection with the Hennigar family. You see, the
senator is Chancellor, chairman of the building committee,
friend of the university in general, and heaviest endower
in particular. If Freeman could have done a
cleverer thing than marry Miss Hennigar, it would
have required a committee of corporation lawyers to
discover it.”</p>

<p>“That’s news to me,” said Mauney. “I appreciate
getting in on a little gossip like this, too. Who’s your
friend here, Miss MacDowell?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“I haven’t any,” she said. “Nutbrown Hennigar
fusses over me at times. But I’m here just because
François met me in the east corridor this morning and
told me I had to come up for dinner. I never made any
bids for getting in with this crowd. I don’t fit, anyway.
But François insisted, and then Madame ’phoned me,
so what could I do?”</p>

<p>“They seem like a friendly bunch of people, though,”
Mauney remarked.</p>

<p>“Friendly!” she returned. “Why not? They’re
pretty nearly all related. There is Alfred Tanner—he’s
a real fellow—but he married Senator Hennigar’s
other daughter. Everybody else here, if not related to
Hennigar, has a very special stand in. It’s the great
eternal family compact. I’ll mention that in my hand-book,
too.”</p>

<p>“But the senator seems to be a good old chap!”</p>

<p>“Certainly. I admire him. You know how he made
all his money, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Jam,” said Miss MacDowell simply. It was apparent
from her animation that she loved talking about the
man. Mauney wondered at her, nevertheless, for it
struck him that she was ill-advised to say so much to a
stranger. Fortunately, everything she had said, thus far,
had struck home with unusual force and greatly appealed
to him. But how could she take the risk of committing
herself so freely?</p>

<p>“You see, it’s just like this,” she said, lowering her
voice and smiling with the mischievous glee of a child
consciously undertaking some deviltry, “Hennigar discovered
early in life that plums and ginger-root blend
in a manner most gratifying to the palate. He persevered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
with his formula. With the austere self-denial
of the specialist, he worked hard and became the arch-confectioner.
He pyramided profits into advertising—”</p>

<p>“Is he the maker of Hennigar’s jam?” interrupted
Mauney, incredulously.</p>

<p>“Of course he is. He kept at it, as I was saying,
until to-day a ten-acre factory buzzes with its manufacture
and the plum-trees on a thousand hills grow for
Hennigar alone. Oh, but it was wonderful jam,” she
laughed, smacking her lips prettily. “It has ‘jammed’
out a small-sized marble palace in Riverton, a fleet of
motor cars from Rolls to Buick, one for every mood, an
army of liveried servants, one for every duty. It has
‘jammed’ Elias Hennigar into the Senate, into the front
ranks of the Church, into the intimate counsels of the
university—in fact, this jam has made him. But, of
course, one doesn’t mention jam, now. He’s got it all
washed off his hands by this time.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t that beat the devil!” exclaimed Mauney.
“Oh, I beg your pardon, Miss MacDowell.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” she laughed. “I like to hear a man cuss.
I sort of know where he stands, then. Listen and I’ll
tell you a secret.”</p>

<p>Mauney leaned a little nearer her.</p>

<p>“I’m going to drop my course this spring,” she whispered,
“and take a job under Professor Freeman as
departmental secretary in history. Won’t that be fun?
I’ll have Alfred Tanner to work with. He’s better
than a circus any time, and then there’s Nutbrown Hennigar.
Have you had him to lecture to you yet? No?
I guess he sticks to the general course students. Well,
he’s a scream, anyway. He’s very, very fond of me,
mind you. Just imagine a Hennigar on my trail. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
takes me to theatres often. And dances—oh, he can’t
dance at all; he just rambles. He thinks it’s awfully
queer of me to have accepted this job in the history department.”</p>

<p>Mauney’s attention was completely engaged by his
charming companion. She puzzled him beyond measure.
Why, he wondered, did she talk so confidently
to him? She did not appear to be a rattle-brained
woman, and yet how strangely familiar she had become.</p>

<p>“Say,” he said, after a little pause. “You’re kind of
human, and I’m just going to ask you a question, if
I may.”</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“Why do you tell me so much?” he asked. “Mind
you, I like it a whole lot. But how did you know I
would like it?”</p>

<p>She laughed tantalizingly.</p>

<p>“Because I know all about you, Mr. Bard,” she replied.</p>

<p>“Me?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. You’re a pal of Max Lee’s, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>His eyes opened with enlightenment.</p>

<p>“Are you Freda MacDowell?” he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>She nodded and teased him with her eyes.</p>

<p>“Of course I am. Max has told me all about you.
When I heard the name Bard, to-night, I wondered if
you were Mauney.”</p>

<p>“I sure am,” he said, warming up, “and this is a
great pleasure, indeed, I—”</p>

<p>“And I was positive it was you,” she interrupted,
with a roguish glance at his face, “because Max told
me you had an awful head of red hair.”</p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smcap">In Which Stalton Sees the Doctor.</span></h3>

<p>Mauney did not enjoy the dinner-party. He
kept looking at Freda MacDowell and wishing
he had never met her. He knew, without further contemplation,
that she was the most attractive woman he
had ever met. He could have gone on talking to her
all evening long, but he was glad that such had been
impossible. Every time he looked at her he felt a
warmth gripping his breast. Her eyes—well, he knew
that he had never seen eyes like them. They were perfect.
They were vastly comforting. They haunted
him, all the way back to Freeman’s, and then all the
way to 73 Franklyn Street. He remembered Max’s description
of her, and knew that it was no idle remark:</p>

<p>“She’s just like nobody else.”</p>

<p>He demanded of life to know just how such a thing
could come to pass, namely, that he should be attracted
so strongly to a woman, all at once, at first sight, at
first talk. Of course he would have to put her clean
out of his mind. He felt weak when he thought of
her. He knew just how much of her he could stand.
He was positive that another hour’s acquaintance would
have completed the most enthralling fascination. He
sat in his own room smoking furiously, trying to accuse
himself of a hyper-vivid imagination and an over-developed
susceptibility. He tried to tell himself that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
was not infatuated with her. He smoked many cigarettes.
It grew late. He pulled down a book and began
reading, with the book in his lap. Then he came to
himself gradually and discovered that he had not been
reading at all, but only inspecting his finger-nails, while
his thoughts kept returning constantly to Freda MacDowell.</p>

<p>Max would wonder why he had not dropped in to-night.
Somehow he could not face Max. He had no
wish to see Max to-night. It would be hard to talk to
him—just as if he had wronged him in some way. Then,
at length, he gained a better perspective of the situation.
He tossed aside his book and walked along the
hall to his chum’s door.</p>

<p>“Hello, you!” said Lee, looking up from his desk,
which was littered with note-books and texts. “You’ve
been dolling up a little, eh? Been at a dance?”</p>

<p>“No, just a kind of dinner party, Max. What are
you doing?”</p>

<p>“Can’t you see?”</p>

<p>“Sure. What is it, though?”</p>

<p>“Oto-laryngology, if you insist.”</p>

<p>“Is it?” asked Mauney, absently, as he leaned against
the wall by the door.</p>

<p>“Well, of course, you fish. If I say it’s oto-laryngology
I don’t mean anything else. What’s the matter
with you? Sit down. I’m out of smokes. If you’ve
got any, hand ’em over.”</p>

<p>Mauney tossed his package of cigarettes on the desk
and stretched himself in a chair near by.</p>

<p>“Well, Max,” he said at length. “You’re the luckiest
dog in Merlton!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“How do you make that out, my son?” Lee asked, as
he turned to throw away a burnt match.</p>

<p>“Because you are, that’s all. You’ve got a woman
who really loves you, and—”</p>

<p>“Wait, now, you poor fish. Did I tell you she loved
me?”</p>

<p>“Well, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t.”</p>

<p>Lee cast a puzzled look at Mauney, who sat, as if in
reverie, gazing up through blue rings of smoke that
emerged in slow clouds from his mouth.</p>

<p>“Are you suddenly overtaken with a bachelor’s remorse?”
Max queried, sarcastically. “Is that why you
come in here to disturb my faithful studies? Why
envy me so much? Why don’t you nab onto somebody
yourself? You’ve got more to recommend you than I
have.”</p>

<p>Mauney was not listening to him, but continued gazing
up at the ceiling. Even there he could not avoid
the vision of a woman’s dark, comforting eyes.</p>

<p>“You’ve got better mating points than I have. You’re a
better man than I am, <i>Gunga-din</i>. Look at that chest
of yours—any woman would sigh petulantly to have
her head pillowed there. All you got to do is to go out
and walk down Tower Street and the girls will be running
into lamp-posts as they turn to behold your
Apollo-like form.”</p>

<p>Mauney looked into Max’s face, confused.</p>

<p>“What?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh I didn’t say anything. I was just humming a
snatch from Mendelssohn’s ‘Fatal Step.’ Say, Mauney,
what the devil’s the matter with you, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right: smoke on. I’m going to study. Stay till
you get it all straightened out, and, when you’re ready
to go, don’t forget the door is on your left. Good-night,
dearie.”</p>

<p>Lee turned to his desk and resumed his reading of
numerous pages of badly-written notes. From time to
time he mumbled sentences, then shifted in his chair,
then lit a new cigarette, and mumbled again. During
this time Mauney sat quietly back, busy with unpleasant
thoughts. He remembered that Lee had explained
the hopelessness of his relationship with Freda
MacDowell. He had said that, although he loved her,
he would never let her know. Mauney had always admired
Max. Now he respected him more than ever.
He thought it was very noble of him to preserve silence
regarding his love.</p>

<p>“I guess we’re both sort of out in the cold, Max,” he
said, at length.</p>

<p>“I guess so,” Lee absent-mindedly agreed, as he continued
to read. “Out in the cold? How do you mean?”</p>

<p>“With women.”</p>

<p>“Oh, damn women. I’m busy with oto-laryngology.
Exam’s coming on to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Mauney rose and stretched himself.</p>

<p>“I’m going to bed,” he announced, tossing his package
of cigarettes again on the table. “Keep ’em; you’ll
need a few fags before morning.”</p>

<p>Mauney resumed his accustomed life next day with
a feeling of gratitude that he had at least his work to
occupy his mind. He put Freda MacDowell out of his
consciousness—she was the property of Maxwell Lee,
and nothing would ever permit him to encroach on his
good friend’s property. She grew smaller as she receded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
in the vista of his thoughts, and he considered
it fortunate that he saw nothing more of her during the
term.</p>

<p>At the spring examinations Lorna Freeman gained
top place, defeating Mauney by many marks and winning
the Hennigar scholarship for proficiency in history.
He congratulated her cordially, and inwardly admitted
her superior ability. She deserved the distinction.
He was not jealous, for even at the end of his
first year his eye was looking at something different
from marks and scholarships. He had passed his
exams—that was all he cared. There were other rewards—quiet,
inner compensations, from the reading
of history. These he had not missed. The story of
humanity was growing real to him, something he could
touch with his hands and cherish. There came thoughts
that pleased his fancy, and he wrote them in a big,
empty ledger—wonderful thoughts about history, that
he wanted no one but himself to read. He prized his
ledger. Many a night during the long summer vacation
he took it from the locked drawer of his desk and added
more paragraphs to it. It was nothing—just his fancies.</p>

<p>Maxwell Lee, having successfully graduated, and having
acquired the degree of M.D., gained an appointment
in the department of biochemistry, as a research fellow,
at a salary of seven hundred dollars a year, and
began work immediately. Mauney was introduced to
his laboratory, a big upstairs room in the Medical
Building, with two bald, great windows that flooded
the place with a brilliant light. It was a busy room,
filled with long tables of intricate apparatus, retorts, gas
burners, and complicated arrangements of glass tubes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
resembling a child’s conception of a factory. He often
dropped in to talk with Lee, who was always absorbed
in his new work, bent over steaming dishes of fluid, or
seated before a delicate scales, contained in a glass
case. He spoke seldom of Freda MacDowell, now, but
much of a certain disease upon which he was working,
in an attempt to discover its cause. Mauney disliked
the laboratory, pungent with fumes of acid, but was
glad to see Max so happy in his work.</p>

<p>Lee still remained at Mrs. Manton’s boarding-house
and in the evenings, when he was not busy at the Medical
Building, was to be found, sitting in his shirt
sleeves, in an alcove of the upstairs hallway, reading
technical treatises on biochemistry.</p>

<p>Fred Stalton gradually formed his own original opinion
about the intense occupation of Lee.</p>

<p>“Since he got that M.D. tacked on to his name,” Stalton
remarked to Mauney one night in the dining-room,
“he’s sort of waded out into biochemistry a little too
deep. Max has changed, Mauney. He’s changed a
lot. When he first came here to stay, he was the life
of the party, a real midnight serenader, believe me.
Of course, I suppose somebody’s got to do the tall studying,
but I hate to see him so much at it. His health
won’t stand it. He’s not very strong. He ought to rig
up an office down on College Street, hang out his shingle
and practise. Why, if he just had the lucre I’ve
spent on doctors he could take a holiday in Honolulu.
People would be bound to come to him. Doctors don’t
do any good except to ease your mind a little, and that’s
why people go to them. You get a pain in your
almanack, and you hike right over to the nearest medico.
He just lays on the hands, tells you it’s a very minor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
trouble; you pay him a couple of bones for a piece of
paper and go home tickled all over. It’s a game, but
Max ought to play it. He’s getting too serious.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” admitted Mauney. “But he’s all taken up
with the idea of striking the cause of pernicious anæmia—”</p>

<p>“Anæmia?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What’s that like?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I couldn’t tell you. Max did describe it to me.
People with it are sort of pale and yellow and lose their
pep.”</p>

<p>Stalton’s brow puckered up thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I wonder if there’s any chance of me having that
lot,” he said slowly. “I certainly haven’t got any more
pep than a Ford car leaking in oil in three cylinders.
Here I am, Mauney, only forty-two years old; I
shouldn’t be like this. I can’t do much more work than a
sundial on a rainy day, without getting all in, down
and out. I’ve been to about a hundred doctors and
only two ever agreed on what ails me.”</p>

<p>“What seems to be the trouble, Fred?”</p>

<p>“All I know is how I feel,” replied Stalton. “Some
say it’s hyperacidity. Some call it auto-intoxication.
One bird claimed I had an ulcer of the stomach. About
ten of ’em laid all the blame on my teeth. Others said
I had weakness of the nerve centres. I don’t believe
any of them ever really hit it yet. As soon as I collect
enough dust I’m going to call and see Adamson.”</p>

<p>“Is he good?” asked Mauney, but casually interested
in Stalton’s recital of his bodily woes.</p>

<p>“Good? I guess he is! That chap, they say, never
makes a mistake. He’s a professor in the Medical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
School. You have to make an appointment four weeks
in advance to see him at all. He charges about a hundred
a minute, but, from what I hear, he’s worth it.
I’d never begrudge it to him. I haven’t been able to
hold down a steady job for five years.”</p>

<p>Mauney had observed Stalton’s manner of life. Gertrude
allowed him to play on an easy financial margin.
He made what money he got by speculating on theatre
tickets, playing the horses at Riverton Park, and from
his rare, but always successful, indulgence in big poker
games down-town. When he was in pocket he paid his
board cheerfully and bought new clothes and quantities
of cigarettes. When he was financially embarrassed
he helped Gertrude with the housework and made his
own cigarettes. He was the soul of good-heartedness.
He would lend money to any of his friends if he had it.
If not, he would thank the intending borrower for the
compliment of being asked. His popularity at 73
Franklyn Street always remained at flood-tide—he was
so cheerful about his own infirmities and so eager to
listen to the troubles of others. Mauney found him
as restful as other men who lived purposeless lives.</p>

<p>Late one night Mauney was awakened by the sound
of his bedroom door opening. In the light which entered
from the hall he beheld Stalton standing in his
bathrobe, smoking a cigarette. He was unusually pale.</p>

<p>“I didn’t want to disturb, Max,” he said, “but I’m
suffering the tortures of the damned with this stomach
of mine. I wonder if you would mind going downstairs
and calling up Dr. Adamson. I’ve got to see that bird,
sooner or later, and I’d like to have him see me when
this real attack is on.”</p>

<p>Mauney agreed, sprang out of bed, and feeling that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Stalton was actually in great pain, persuaded him to
take his own bed. After helping him to get into it, he
covered him quickly with the sheets and descended to
the telephone. After giving the number he waited for
fully a minute before receiving a reply.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said a tired, business-like voice at length.</p>

<p>“Doctor Adamson?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Could you come to seventy-three Franklin Street?”</p>

<p>“What appears wrong?” he asked pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Stalton has a severe pain in his stomach.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s unfortunate,” he replied. “It might be a
surgical case, you know. Anyway I never go out at
night, except under very exceptional circumstances. I
think you had better call my assistant, Dr. Turner.”</p>

<p>“Well, listen, doctor,” persisted Mauney, “Mr. Stalton
is a fine chap and he thinks the sun rises and sets
on you.”</p>

<p>The physician laughed.</p>

<p>“Indeed? Well, that’s very nice of him,” he said.
“Tell him I’ll break a custom. Seventy-three Franklin?
I’ll be up soon.”</p>

<p>Within half an hour the distinguished physician arrived.
He was a cheerful, clean-shaven, well-dressed
man of perhaps forty-five, and looked extremely awake,
considering the hour. Mauney showed him upstairs to
his room and introduced him to the patient.</p>

<p>“How do you do?” said Dr. Adamson, pleasantly, as
he took Stalton’s proffered hand. “Are you in trouble?”</p>

<p>“I feel as if there was a mud-turtle inside my
stomach, doctor, trying to land on the edge of my liver,”
confessed Stalton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Adamson laughed as he drew up a chair, and sat
down leisurely beside the bed.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, in his cheerful way, “your description
lacks nothing in vividness. Do you think he will
manage to land?”</p>

<p>Stalton put his palm over the pit of his stomach.</p>

<p>“Right there,” he said.</p>

<p>“Pain?” queried Adamson.</p>

<p>“It isn’t exactly pain, doctor. It’s an all-gone feeling.
If it would only pain I’d know where I stood.
But it really doesn’t pain—it’s just sort of churning.”</p>

<p>Adamson’s grey eyes became keen, as he inspected
his patient.</p>

<p>“When did you first notice it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I’ve had it for ten years; only it’s got unbearable
to-night.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” nodded the physician, as he lapsed into
a silence, and felt his patient’s pulse.</p>

<p>“Are you a student?” he asked, glancing about the
room.</p>

<p>“No. This is Mr. Bard’s room. I haven’t followed
any regular occupation for a few years back.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I don’t seem to have the pep, doctor.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. Do you have headaches?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Right in the dome,” explained Stalton, placing his
hand on the top of his head.</p>

<p>“Exactly. Any backache?”</p>

<p>“You’re right.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>“All the way from my neck to my heels.
My legs ache most of the time, too.”</p>

<p>After the physician had very carefully examined him
he dropped his stethescope into his bag, which he closed
with a snap.</p>

<p>“What horse is going to get the Lofton Plate to-morrow?”
he asked, as he sat down and lit a cigarette
and proffered the case to his patient.</p>

<p>“I’d bet on the Grundy stables to-morrow, doctor.”</p>

<p>“You think so?”</p>

<p>“Sure. I don’t pose as an expert, but if I had the
money I’d play Grundy to win for a thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“I used to imagine I could pick the winners,” laughed
Adamson. “I think every man passes through that
stage.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the sooner he passes it the better,” smiled
Stalton.</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>For a few seconds the physician smoked in silence.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with me, doctor?” asked Stalton,
at length.</p>

<p>“Are you prepared for my verdict?” replied Adamson,
somewhat seriously.</p>

<p>“Well—yes—that’s why I sent for you. I know you
will tell me.”</p>

<p>“No matter how serious, I presume you would rather
know the truth?”</p>

<p>“You bet I would,” said Stalton, perching himself up
on his elbow, and gazing with fearful apprehension at
the renowned physician. “Some doctors said there
wasn’t anything wrong with me.”</p>

<p>“But there is,” said Adamson, emphatically.</p>

<p>“Well, I knew it, I—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“You have a really serious complaint, Mr. Stalton.”</p>

<p>“Is there any hope of curing it?”</p>

<p>“That all depends on you, Mr. Stalton. But first let
me explain. And in doing so I want you to believe
every word I say. I don’t want you to be hurt by anything
I say, either. I have given you a careful examination
and have located your trouble, but it’s not
the kind of trouble you think it is.”</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>“No. Your stomach is anatomically normal, although
it is not working in perfect physiological harmony. It
is influenced by your mind very considerably. Your
head contains a real ache, and your back contains a
real ache, and your legs get really tired. You feel
weak most of the time. You find it hard to stick at
one occupation. These are real troubles, not imaginary.
Your body is—well, rather rebellious against work. Is
that not true?”</p>

<p>“It certainly is, doctor. I—”</p>

<p>“Exactly. It doesn’t want to be put to a test, where
it knows it will be unsuccessful.”</p>

<p>“You’ve sure expressed it, doctor.”</p>

<p>“And now, Mr. Stalton,” said Adamson, leaning back
in his chair and fixing his patient with his keen, grey
eyes, “would you believe me if I told you that your
body is merely working in harmony with a wrong idea
in your mind?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’d believe anything you say, doctor,” said
Stalton, slowly, but with evident surprise.</p>

<p>“Good. I appreciate your confidence very much. You
have a wrong thought complex. In some way or other
you have acquired a wrong mental attitude toward
work. It’s not your fault. I do not blame you in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
least. But I want to remove that thought complex, because
in so doing I will remove your disease, and if
you will but believe me now, you will be immediately
cured. You have for the past few years actually feared
work.”</p>

<p>“I know it, doctor, but I—”</p>

<p>“This fear of work has been a real disease, Mr.
Stalton. You feared work. You mentally rebelled
against work. Your body took its cue from your mind
and rebelled also. Your body rebelled so much that
it instituted pains and aches, so as to avoid the thing
your brain feared. In other words, your whole trouble
has been a mental and physical rebellion against work.
Do you believe me or not?”</p>

<p>“Well, doctor, I’ve got to believe you,” said Stalton
slowly. “But what am I to do?”</p>

<p>“First, you are going to remind yourself that work
is really a blessing—nothing to be feared—but rather
something to be desired. It will not hurt you. I give
my word. You need not have this old timidity any
longer. In the second place, you are going to get a
job somewhere at once and begin to work steadily at it.
Have you any trade?”</p>

<p>“I learned electric wiring years ago.”</p>

<p>“Fine. Go to-morrow, confidently, and get a job,
wiring. If you do, you will find all your pains and
aches gradually disappearing. If I am wrong, I will
charge you nothing for this call. I know I’m right.”</p>

<p>“How much do I owe you, doctor?” asked Stalton,
getting out of bed, as the physician started toward the
door.</p>

<p>“It will be twenty-five dollars,” he replied. “But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
I would like it to be the next twenty-five you earn.
Good-night.”</p>

<p>He extended his hand.</p>

<p>“Good-night, sir,” said Stalton, taking it. “I believe
you’ve hit the nail on the head.”</p>

<p>When Mauney returned to his room, after accompanying
Adamson to the door, he found Fred Stalton
walking up and down.</p>

<p>“What do you know about that, Mauney?” he asked.
“That bird certainly put his finger on the tender spot
that time. In one way I feel like a damned slacker
now. Don’t mention this to anybody, Mauney. But
Adamson is right. Why, that pain is gone already.
I’m a liar if it isn’t. No drugs about that bird. I’m
going out to-morrow to buck the old world for a living
again.”</p>

<p>A few weeks saw a great change in Stalton. He embraced
work with a good will and never once faltered.
He obtained a good position with a down-town electrical
company, and came home each night hungry and
happy. Gertrude was puzzled completely.</p>

<p>“Why, Freddie!” she said one night, “you’re all better.
What on earth did it? You look ten years
younger, and I haven’t heard a word about teeth
for a long time.”</p>

<p>“Do you remember that last bottle of Burton’s Bitter
Tonic I punished?” he asked with a broad smile.
“Well, it’s the greatest stuff on record. I’m going to
pose for a portrait and give ’em a red-hot personal letter
of recommendation to put in the newspaper. ‘It
has cured me—why not others? Eventually—why not
now? At all druggists, the same wonderful, world-beating,
little tonic!’”</p>

<p>The next two years passed very quickly for Mauney,
with few perceptible changes. The war was over.
Merlton, one day, had gone crazy with armistice celebration,
only to settle down on the next to its usual
life. The university was crowded now with returned
soldiers. It was a familiar scene to behold the great
square dotted with limping students still in uniform.
The sight of them brought sharp emotions to Mauney—mingled
sympathy for their sufferings and regret that
he had been denied a share in their adventures in
France. He knew that he, himself, had been peculiarly
untouched by the war. Nevertheless, the stupendous
event had made an impression upon him, the more
severe by reason of his own non-participation in it.
A sensitive depth in his nature was perpetually harrowed
by thought of it. Having, by this time, followed
the records of history from their dim beginnings up
to the present, he was confronted, as was every one, by
an impassable barrier, which refused to yield to any
philosophic explanation. Perhaps he was too near the
catastrophe, in time, to gain the needed perspective. But
the facts were constantly before him. Something had
slipped in the great, good purpose of God. In the substrata
of life a tremendous fault had occurred, bearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
its outward upheavals of death, suffering and disorder.</p>

<p>Three years at college had made a great difference
in Mauney Bard. He had passed through the academic
terms, like the unnoticed steps of a great staircase, without
noticing that he was, in a sense, always climbing.
He was climbing nearer to something—something perceived
to be intangible, but worthy.</p>

<p>From his humble beginnings on Lantern Marsh
farm, where his perspective was hedged by blind walls
of pettiness on every side, he had emerged into a grateful
breadth of vision, where, at his very feet, lay the
treasures of accumulated knowledge and whence, too,
the horizon was attractive with mystery.</p>

<p>He had become a man, at length, with a man’s viewpoint
and a mature sense of a personal participation
in the affairs of the world. Three years of history
had brought him to a point of view which included
himself. Every student cannot be so favored by the
unseen mechanism which moulds personality. Many,
including the brilliant Miss Lorna Freeman, failed nothing
in gaining an accurate knowledge of history. She
seemed in eagerness for learning to be like the dry,
cracked earth, eager for the rain that never quite fills
it; but with all her great capacity for information she
lacked the quality that had made Mauney older and
more serious. The war did not make any appreciable
difference in Lorna. It was a phenomenon, similar to,
if vaster than, other wars, which would, in due course,
afford her fascinating study. But to Mauney it had
already loomed up as a vital obstacle to his philosophy
of optimism, for all things culminated in it. All good
that had ever been, met in it a blasting contradiction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
All hope of a satisfactory society met in it a destructive
rebuff; all the quivering aspirations of his own developing
mind found in it a dark abyss, frightful
enough to quench them.</p>

<p>So it was that Mauney, at the end of his third year,
lost immediate interest in his academic work and grappled
with a problem of reality.</p>

<p>He grew serious and questioning. His auburn hair,
which had darkened until its color was scarcely present,
was parted carelessly above a face somewhat paled by
thought, a face whose blue eyes were intense with sharp
mental strife, and whose lips had changed from their
boyish happiness to the determined line of serious manhood.</p>

<p>His problems had thus changed a good deal from
the time when they concerned merely his personal liberty,
for they now concerned rather the liberty
of the human race. He had gradually emerged
from selfish considerations. He had lost touch with
his family. Old bonds no longer held him. The new
thing—the cosmic consciousness—which he owed to the
university training, took possession of his mind. Wonderful
gift of the college! That a man, through its
agency, should unconsciously loose himself from all
that relates to personal passion and tune his being to
the pitch of the general passion of mankind!</p>

<p>From Maxwell Lee, constantly bent over his laboratory
desks, constantly delving into the secrets of disease,
constantly at work, heroically striving against
handicaps of poverty and ill-health, he absorbed a great
truth of conduct, for he gradually came to understand
that it was the vast desire for human betterment that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
inspired this frail, but active, research student. Max
loomed bigger than ever in his esteem. Three or four
years had ripened their friendship, tested it in many
ways, and proven it to be solid. Neither of them cared
to leave 73 Franklin Street, partly because Mrs. Manton
and Fred Stalton and the others had become
strange fixtures in their lives, but mainly because they
meant more to each other than either quite realized.</p>

<p>And Freda MacDowell had joined the ranks. Shortly
after dropping out of her arts course she had met Gertrude
and adopted 73 Franklin as her boarding house.
She had now served two years as secretary in the Department
of History, and was no more favorably impressed
by education than on the evening of her conversation
with Mauney at Professor de Freville’s.
Frequently she had a good deal to say on the subject,
although Mauney always tried to avoid her. She had
the big front room opposite Max’s on the first floor,
and there was a tasteful alcove with a desk and chairs
in the hallway, where Max and she always sat to talk.</p>

<p>Apparently she had at last found her ideal boarding
house. Her taste, cultivated by a half-dozen seasons
in Merlton, and moulded by a gradual elimination of
features objectionable or stereotyped, had become as
whimsical as a middle-aged Parisian’s taste in diet. Two
years as an undergraduate of the university had sufficed
to draw the ban upon women’s residences and the
mild espionage of fellow students. Her third year in
arts had taught her conclusively that living with a maternal
aunt was laying oneself needlessly open to constant
misinterpretation. There were things she wanted
to do—such as show herself friendly with Max Lee.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
There were other things which she did—such as allow
Nutbrown Hennigar to call upon her. Evidently, Mrs.
Manton’s house furnished what she wanted—freedom,
comfort, protection from idle scandal. At any rate
Mauney drew as much from her usual conversations.</p>

<p>But he was too busy to be greatly concerned with
Freda; and, moreover, he had long since decided that
she belonged to Lee. Max occasionally denied this,
and characterized their relationship as merely a good
friendship, but Mauney heard between his words.</p>

<p>Moreover there was Lorna Freeman, whom he had
watched develop into an attractive womanhood. They
were still together daily. He still took dinner at the
professor’s occasionally and followed dinner with long
discussions in the smoky study upstairs. He liked the
Freemans. He liked Lorna. He liked Merlton and his
university life.</p>

<p>But at the end of three years, with only one more
year to study, he began to take synoptic views of the
general situation and to cast into the immediate future
for a career.</p>

<p>During his fourth year the problem of a life-work
forced itself upon him.</p>

<p>He told Professor Freeman his troubles as they
smoked together. The historian seemed to appreciate
the confidence.</p>

<p>“Well, Mauney,” he said seriously, “The logical thing
for you to do is to find out what you are best fitted
for, and take up that work. You will be graduating
next spring. The world is before you. No one but
yourself can decide the question.”</p>

<p>Hours when Mauney might have been cogitating on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the subject, were usually spent in delightful loneliness
in his room, writing down his thoughts on history in
his ledger, which had now grown to be a considerable
volume of literature. He took it out of its long privacy
one evening to show to Lorna. He read her snatches
of things he had written, consciously opening the somewhat
sacred recesses of his being to her. When he
asked her for an opinion she had little to say.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s pretty stuff!” she admitted coolly—“a sort
of effervescence from a student’s mind!”</p>

<p>She was right. He mentally applauded her judgment.
Surely, after all, it was nothing else. All the
nights he had spent on it! All the impassioned moments
he had worked to express his personal ideas of history!
Nothing but a sort of effervescence! Surely,
she was right. Cold, frank, truthful Lorna! How
his admiration was wrung from him by her bald statement!
He had wanted her to like it tremendously and
praise it and acclaim it as worthy writing. But now
he felt like thanking her for categorizing it with accurate
appraisal. How accurate she was! “Effervescence!”
When he returned home he threw the ledger
down on his desk.</p>

<p>“Damn this effervescence!” he cursed with ruffled
feelings. “Damn my student’s mind! If this isn’t real
then I’m not real.”</p>

<p>Of course, the situation in the class, with only two
of them, always the same two, was provocative of a
strain between them. He never felt that they had discovered
the very thing that she had recommended in
the stilted language of her first year—a <i lang="la">modus vivendi</i>.</p>

<p>She consistently defeated him at the examinations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
although he was quite indifferent to the fact. He
noticed a peculiar jealousy in her that came to the surface
at odd moments, when their respective intelligences
were compared by the challenge of academic demands.
He knew that, often enough, he could have
answered a tutor’s question first, but that he refrained
in order to give her the advantage of priority.</p>

<p>She had become a beautiful woman, a blonde goddess
of severely classical line and color. When he
looked at her he favored her intelligence, and continued
to accord her priority. But he felt that she was overshadowing
and hindering him, and that a <i lang="la">modus vivendi</i>
could be discovered only by some spiritual change in
their relationship.</p>

<p>One solution seemed to be a personal declaration of
independence. She deserved, no doubt, to be regarded
as an academic rival, and thus treated; for, if ever an
opportunity came for her to defeat him by a clever
word or argument she never held back. If now, he
were to retaliate, forgetting her sex, and try earnestly
to beat her at her own game of wit, he would be truer
to himself, and would create a more natural relationship
in the class.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, a different solution cropped
up. If, by any means, he could spiritually overshadow
her, break down her being into dependence upon his
own; if, in short, he could but touch her affections, he
would thus create harmony in the class, as well as accomplish
a desirable feat. He knew well enough that
he had ached to touch her hidden heart. He had sat,
for nearly four years, looking at her, admiring her body
as well as her mind, but had never been able once to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
tell her in words, or in any other way, just how he felt
about her.</p>

<p>This problem added itself to the several others that
confronted him. He accused himself over and over
of continued weakness. He must do something about
Lorna Freeman. That was the great certitude before
him. She could not be ignored. It was incumbent upon
him either to dislike her or love her. Which would it
be? She was like a bulky obstacle in his path, that
could not be moved. His progress depended on shoving
her aside or else winning her. Naturally he embraced
the second method, as a trial.</p>

<p>He hired a car one autumn evening and took her
driving out past Riverton into the country. The air
was crisp and the west aglow with luminous green.</p>

<p>“You seem frightfully serious, Mauney,” she remarked.</p>

<p>“So I am,” he admitted. “I’ve never been more
serious in my life.”</p>

<p>She glanced from under her black hat and smiled a
little impatiently.</p>

<p>“When one goes for a motor-drive one doesn’t
usually like to be so oppressively serious, does one?
Have I the right to enquire as to what is making you
so much absorbed in your thoughts?”</p>

<p>He nodded as he turned toward her.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said forcibly. “You’ve got a peach of a
right to ask. I’m serious about you.”</p>

<p>“Me?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ve tried for four years to get something
said, and you’ve always been so preoccupied with an
overweening interest in the surrounding world, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
I’ve never managed to say anything. Even now I
haven’t got five cents’ worth of assurance. I don’t
altogether blame myself, either. I’m not an especially
timid or fearful creature. I usually say what I want
to say and let the devil take the consequences. And
that, Lorna, is what I’m going to do right now.”</p>

<p>She was surprised. Her blue eyes widened. Her
perfect, if severe, lips opened to reply, but he was leaning
toward her, ready to interrupt.</p>

<p>“Why have I always been so meekly worshipful?”
he demanded. “Why have I always let you have your
way? Is it just because you are a woman? If so—if
you are a woman—why don’t you sometimes treat me
as if you were?”</p>

<p>Her face was a picture of utter astonishment.</p>

<p>“Mauney Bard!” she exclaimed. “Why don’t you
ask me one question at a time? You seem dreadfully
upset about something, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he admitted, as he leaned closer to her. “I
am. I’m upset over you.”</p>

<p>She was strikingly good-looking at the moment. Her
customary classical paleness was gone. A warmth of
color, provoked by some sudden emotion, had usurped
its place. She was surprised by his words and her
eyes frankly looked her confusion.</p>

<p>“Lorna,” he said, putting his arm about her shoulders.
“I had to bring you here, away from everything.
I—”</p>

<p>“Don’t!” she implored, drawing quickly back. “I—I
can’t!”</p>

<p>Then she made a queer, gurgling sound in her throat,
tried to speak, and ended by weeping with her face
held between her hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>As the car sped on Mauney sat regarding her in
absolute mystification.</p>

<p>“Why on earth does the girl weep?” he meditated.
“What have I done to her? Is my proffer of love an
insult?”</p>

<p>It was a hoax of a drive. It became unbearable.
After a long silence he ventured to change the subject
entirely, and found her presently quite agreeable to
talk about other matters. He was glad when he at
last put her down at her home and said good-night.
Then, returning to the car, he drove to the Medical
Building, where the windows of Lee’s laboratory were
brilliantly lighted. After paying the driver he stood for
a few moments on the walk trying to collect his self-control.
He wanted to see Max, but knew that unless
he paused he would stamp into the laboratory like a
madman. He owed Lee some deference on account of
the latter’s important work. It was ten minutes before
he opened the great front door of the building and
ascended the iron staircase to the first floor. He rapped
on the laboratory door.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” came Lee’s voice, in an unnatural
tone.</p>

<p>“Mauney.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>In a moment Max unlocked the door and stepped
back. He had a bottle of whiskey in his hand with a
corkscrew stuck into the cork. Without noticing
Mauney’s surprised expression, he turned to walk to a
table where he continued his occupation of trying to
draw the cork. His lean body was clothed in his long,
white, laboratory gown, and his black hair hung in confusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
over his pale face. He evidently forgot that something
in the present scene was bound to be dramatically
new to Mauney. Without explanation he drawled, in his
gentle voice:</p>

<p>“This whiskey, Mauney, is neither Olympian nectar
nor fixed bayonets. I’ve frequently sipped better spirits,
and I’ve occasionally tasted worse. Like you and me,
my son, it was made before the war. Fortunately it
lacks the throaty sting of recent distillation, but, on the
other hand, it can hardly be said to possess the superb
smoothness, the velvety, liqueur-like softness of real old
spirits, such as I, and such as you, no doubt, have, at
sundry times and in divers places, imbibed. I use the
word ‘imbibed’ advisedly, and with nice selection from
the swarm of verbs meaning to drink, such as sip, taste,
sample, swallow, tipple, to say nothing of swig, and to
leave out of consideration entirely such inelegant terms
as snort, or even gargle.”</p>

<p>Mauney was leaning against the desk watching him
curiously and smiling at his mood. He wondered
especially why Max was drinking.</p>

<p>“Do you want any help?” he asked, seeing that Lee
still struggled with the cork.</p>

<p>“No, I scorn your assistance,” he laughed. “There
we are! Pop! It had a nice pop, hadn’t it? And
here’s your glass. I suppose you’re drinking?”</p>

<p>“Why, Max, old fellow! I’ll drink with you, yes.
I’m in a good mood for murder or anything, to-night.”</p>

<p>Lee held up a beaker full of whiskey.</p>

<p>“Murder—eh? If that’s how you feel put that glass
back on the desk. Don’t touch it. You’re not in a
fit mood for drinking, my son. In order to drink one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
should be bathed in delightful reminiscences; one
should feel at peace with the spacious present and most
hopeful for the future.”</p>

<p>“And yet,” Mauney said, looking into his friend’s
dark eyes, “I don’t seem to think you’re in that delightful
mood either. What’s wrong?”</p>

<p>Lee laughed rather unrestrainedly. After quaffing
off the beaker of liquor he filled the receptacle with
water from a tap, drank it, smacked his lips, and then,
putting down the beaker on the desk, lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>“I’m not really drunk, Mauney,” he replied more
soberly. “I’m taking this stuff for stimulation. My
health is not the best, unfortunately. Keep it dark; but
I was up to pay a visit to Dr. Adamson this afternoon.
Well, he went over my chest, and I guess I know why
they turned me down for the army. I’ve got T.B. all
right, so he thinks. Don’t be alarmed—”</p>

<p>“But you shouldn’t be working,” interrupted Mauney,
in great astonishment over the news.</p>

<p>“So Adamson tried to tell me. But it’s the fibrotic
type—just a sort of shrivelling of one lung. Not a
bit contagious, you know. Of course it weakens me,
sure enough. And I do think it’s a damned great misfortune,
my son. Here I have my work pretty near
in hand”—he made a gesture toward the apparatus that
littered the desks—“and another year’s work would
probably give me the secret I’m after. I’m on the
track, Mauney; I’m on the track.”</p>

<p>“Good.”</p>

<p>A tremendous pity for Lee possessed him, a pity that
one man could never express to another. He thought
of the quiet, gradual process of disease that had gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
on in Max’s body, steadily sapping his strength. Why
should fate have ordained this brilliant student to bear
a disease that might have been visited more reasonably
upon one who could never mean so much to the cause
of science?</p>

<p>“Now, what I intend doing is to work on until I
finish this bit of research work,” Max informed him.
“If I discover the cause of pernicious anæmia I’ll be
fairly happy, as you can imagine. If I don’t—well,
I’ll have another whack at it after I rest up and get
back in shape. I’m going to work right now. There’s
a chair and some cigarettes, Mauney. Sit down and
stay a while anyway.” He turned presently from his
laboratory apparatus. “But you didn’t explain your
murderous mood. What’s the matter?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s nothing worth talking about,” Mauney replied,
simply.</p>

<p>Whether it was worth talking about or not, the next
few days seemed to prove that it was worth thinking
about. He found himself in the same unsatisfactory relation
to Lorna as ever. He called one evening and
asked her if she would like to stroll with him on their
back lawn.</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” she consented, “although it does sound
childish, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>It was far from childish to Mauney. He looked
down upon her pale, exquisite face, as they sat on a
bench in the faded twilight and knew that something
had to be done about her. He was determined not to
let another day pass without settling once and for all
the relationship that was to exist between them. Here
beside him on the bench was the one woman who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
managed to cast a constant spell of attraction over him.
For three years she had occupied a good deal of his
thoughts. During this time he had become tolerably
well acquainted with himself and longed now to become
acquainted with the woman who had always held him
so coolly at arm’s length. He was particularly curious
to know what explanation existed for her conduct
a few nights previously in the motor car. Why had
she resisted his embrace?</p>

<p>“Lorna,” he said, at length, “I want to ask you a
question. It may not mean much to you, but it means
a lot to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mauney,” she said, with just a fleck of impatience
in her voice. “I’ve been dreading this conversation.
I know what you want to ask me and I’m not
at all certain that I can explain. And yet I can’t very
easily deny you the right to ask.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you could in fairness, Lorna. I
merely want to know why you repelled me the other
night, when I tried to kiss you. Tell me if there was
any other motive than just plain lack of affection for
me. Was that it?”</p>

<p>He was leaning toward her for her reply, and his
arm which lay across the back of the seat, touched her
shoulders lightly. She did not move from the caress.</p>

<p>“Look here, Mauney,” she said, in such a clear, unhampered
tone that he almost started. “I think I can
explain. I’ve always liked you a lot. You’ve always
been a perfect gentleman to me. I’ve always admired
your courtesy at all times. And I’ve always liked your
ideas. I think I could have gone on for ever, dreaming
life with you if—if—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“If what, Lorna?”</p>

<p>“If you hadn’t spoiled—I mean, when you tried to
take me in your arms, that was a totally unknown
idea. Not so much that, perhaps, but it was beyond
me entirely. I felt that it symbolized something big,
yet something so vastly new and foreign to my mind
that I was frightened.”</p>

<p>“Frightened?”</p>

<p>“That’s it, exactly,” she nodded. “I was frightened
at having a new vista of life opened up suddenly, that
way—unawares, taken off guard, if you can understand.
I wasn’t ready for it. You see, my mind is,
in many ways, inexperienced. I don’t know men at
all. You’ve had more emotional experience than I have.
I didn’t mean to be cruel. In fact, that’s why I cried,
because I was afraid I had hurt your feelings.”</p>

<p>A street lamp on Crandall Street now blossomed into
light and sent a long, glancing shaft against her face.
Mauney quivered with attraction.</p>

<p>“Are you actually afraid of me, Lorna?” he asked.</p>

<p>She looked up into his eyes a moment very thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“No—I guess not,” she replied, with a noticeable
hesitancy.</p>

<p>“Listen,” he said, leaning nearer her and grasping
her hand. “I’ve been torn to bits over you for three
years. I’ve tried to put you out of my mind, but
couldn’t. What’s the use of going on the way we
have been?” even as he spoke his arm pressed her
shoulders close to him, while she looked up into his
face, pale and apprehensive.</p>

<p>“Don’t you try to get away from me, either,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
said in a stern voice as she pushed with her hand
against his bosom. “I won’t stand for that any longer.
You’ve got to listen to me, Lorna.”</p>

<p>A dim passion akin to revenge possessed him. He
pressed her close an instant and kissed her full upon
the lips. Then she wilted, and dropped her head softly,
with little sobs, against his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Lorna,” he said. “Will you be my wife?”</p>

<p>She did not reply, but remained sheltered within the
circle of his arms.</p>

<p>“You do me a great honor,” she said at length, in
a low voice. “But I will certainly have to consider
this business very carefully. I’ll tell you soon.”</p>

<p>“How soon?”</p>

<p>“In about a month, I guess.”</p>

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smcap">Mauney Finds a Friend.</span></h3>

<p>While Mauney waited the month for Lorna’s
matrimonial verdict, he occupied himself chiefly
with study and with more writing in his ledger. Whatever
might be the true character of these flashing impressions
which he jotted down, they had become an
essential part of existence, for they came to him with
imperativeness.</p>

<p>The alcove in the hallway upstairs was a good place
to write. He found that he could arrange his thoughts
better within earshot of other people talking than
within the quietness of his own room. The dull,
monotonous murmur of conversation from the dining
room below had the peculiar effect of keeping him
psychically in touch with humanity. The frequent selections
of the gramophone music, with the sound of Gertrude’s
feet slipping gracefully along the floor in the
rhythm of a dance, or the voice of Fred Stalton singing
some popular song to the gramophone’s accompaniment,
reminded him that history was concerned with
all people, that it was not a subject of mere academic
interest, but of life and blood, of gaiety and despair,
of every emotion that warmed or cooled the hearts of
people. Freda MacDowell would often pass him,
seated by the hall desk, on her way to her room, nodding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
with a friendly smile or indulging in a short word
or two of conversation.</p>

<p>One evening she showed considerable interest in
the subject of his labors, and excused herself for asking
upon what he might be so assiduously bent.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’m wasting time, Miss MacDowell,” he
said, looking up from his big volume. “It’s a hobby I
have. Just scribbling down my impressions.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter whether it’s waste time or not,”
she said, “as long as you like doing it. I wish you’d
loosen up a little, Mr. Bard, and invite me to read
your stuff. Having seen you at work so constantly
here every night, you can’t blame me for having
a woman’s curiosity.”</p>

<p>“Nothing would suit me better,” he laughed. “If
I had thought you would be interested I would have
invited you long ago.”</p>

<p>He rose and indicated a chair near his own.</p>

<p>“If you have time,” he said. “But perhaps you are
busy.”</p>

<p>“Me—busy? Oh no! I’m the most leisurely person
in the world. I’m just crazy to read your impressions.
But what are your impressions about?”</p>

<p>She sat down and leaned her elbows on the edge of
the desk.</p>

<p>“History.”</p>

<p>“Dear me,” she sighed, with a little chuckle. “How
disappointing. I, too, have my own impressions of
history, or should I say the history machine. I thought
you were writing a romance with a lot of thrills in it.
However, I’m anxious to see what you think of
history.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>For a moment she turned through the pages of his
scrap-book, reading odd paragraphs here and there.</p>

<p>“I’d rather talk to you about it,” she admitted, at
length. “I’ll start by asking you what history is.”</p>

<p>“I’m not strong on definitions,” he replied, glancing
at the base of the desk lamp, purposely to avoid the
gaze of her deep eyes. “And I’m hopeless when subjected
to a catechism.”</p>

<p>“Good. I knew you were. If I were to ask Nutbrown
Hennigar that question—of course I know better—he’d
proceed to bore me for an hour. Do you
know, I hate history like sin. I wouldn’t stay at this
job of mine, except I’ve got to live by the sweat of
my brow. There’s Robert Freeman—just a kind of
hard-boiled brains—he gives me the creeps. Alfred
Tanner is bad enough. He’s pretty well submerged in
the business, too, although he has preserved a sense of
humor. And Hennigar. What <em>do</em> you think?”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Mauney.</p>

<p>“He’s writing a history of the war,” she laughed. “I
read some of his manuscript. He invited me to do so.”
She looked a playful reproach at Mauney, as though conscious
of her self-invitation to read his writings. “And
it’s just the most amusing thing ever! He’s got the
whole war so definitely sized up that you don’t feel
any surprise at anything that happened. You feel that
the war was just as natural as taking your coffee into
the drawing room after dinner. You feel that the
strategic movements in the battles cost nobody a moment’s
thought. The soldiers just emerge from the
west salient and the east flank like so many automatic
chess-pieces headed for their preordained positions.
There’s no smoke or explosions or blood in his battles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
at all. Just 3,000 casualties, 500 prisoners, and a dent
in the Allied line or the German line. He’s done it
so hardheadedly that I’ve nicknamed him Napoleon.”</p>

<p>“But isn’t he a pretty good friend of yours, Miss
MacDowell?”</p>

<p>“Oh, wonderfully good,” she smiled sarcastically. “He
thrives on destructive criticism, and he really receives
nothing else from me. The more I criticize him the
more he thinks of me. I’ve never given him a single
word of encouragement, never, and yet he keeps right
on my trail. There used to be a saying that the best
man is the one that’s hardest for a woman to get. Hennigar
can’t qualify—he’s the hardest to get rid of.”</p>

<p>“Funny,” said Mauney. “I half knew that was the
case.”</p>

<p>“Well, I must go and dress,” she said, rising. “He’s
taking me to a dance to-night and I don’t want to keep
him waiting over an hour. His car has been at the
door for twenty minutes already. By the way, I wish
you would put your manuscript in on my desk. I’ll
be home some time to-night and would like to look
over it.”</p>

<p>At breakfast next morning he asked her what she
thought of his writings.</p>

<p>“My judgment isn’t worth a Chinese nickel,” she
replied. “But I read it all and I think it’s a whizz
and when I enjoy anything like that it must be unusual
anyhow. I think it’s just like you, and I thought of
a dandy scheme just before I lopped off to sleep. Would
you like to know what it is?”</p>

<p>“You bet,” said Mauney eagerly.</p>

<p>“Well I’ll tell you. I think you ought to whip it
into shape, call it ‘The Teaching of History’ or some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
such title, and have it published. It’s a direct slam on
the conventional methods of teaching history. It would
start a mild sensation and sell like life-preservers at a
shipwreck.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of publishing it,” Mauney admitted.</p>

<p>“Give <em>me</em> credit for the idea,” she laughed. “I’ve
had an awful lot of experience with manuscripts, especially
historical ones. Now, I’m game to take all
that dope of yours down in shorthand from dictation
and type it, if you approve of the idea.”</p>

<p>Mauney’s eyes burned with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“It’s a go!” he said, “Do you really mean it?”</p>

<p>“Try me, fair sir,” she yawned.</p>

<p>“Of course I will insist on paying you for your services,
Miss MacDowell.”</p>

<p>“Naturally,” she said. “You didn’t think I’d work
for nothing, did you?”</p>

<p>It was decided to wait until the Christmas holidays
before commencing work on the manuscript. Mauney
had an invitation to spend Christmas in Lockwood, at
Jean Byrne’s, but this could be easily declined. He
knew that Jean was anxious to have him come to Lockwood
after his own graduation, to teach in the High
School. Her letter mentioned the fact that the present
master in history was leaving in the spring, thus creating
a vacancy. But to teach in Lockwood held no attraction
for Mauney, and as for spending Christmas
at her home—it would not be as enjoyable as getting to
work on his manuscript.</p>

<p class="tb">Lorna’s verdict was not given. Mauney saw her
every day and found that, having once propounded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
question that vexed his soul and having once broken
down the barrier of reserve between them, their relationship
was much more workable. She treated him
now, at last, like a woman, with more of the woman’s
art in her general address.</p>

<p>But Mauney’s nature was severely independent.
While he waited to learn her decision, he remained more
strictly a friend than ever. He wanted her to decide
the big question without the slightest influence from
him. He was strangely content with his own attitude.
He possessed enough masculine irrationality to feel
boundlessly satisfied with what he had done, and failed
to observe with what stolid apathy he was awaiting the
result. One thing he knew—that he had taken up a
definite attitude toward his old classmate, that had at
least settled the unrest.</p>

<p>What particular arguments Lorna might be employing
in the delicate mental process of arriving at a decision
he was far from knowing, but he was tolerably
certain that she had taken her family into her confidence,
for the Professor and Mrs. Freeman both exhibited
a new and fresher interest in him on the occasions
he visited their home. Behind Freeman’s cold,
grey eyes lurked a stealthy light of objective analysis
that rendered Mauney uncomfortable. Nothing was
said for a time, until one Sunday evening after dinner
the professor referred again to his choice of a career.</p>

<p>“It’s very hard, Mauney, to make up one’s mind what
to do,” he said quietly, with his customary smile. “You
have, of course, before you the question of an academic
career. It takes considerable courage to adopt such a
life-work. There are many dangers of scholarship,
such as the tendency to stereotypy and the temptations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
to mental error. Then again, the scholar’s work is unspectacular.”
Freeman raised his long index finger for
emphasis. “You do not need to mind that. The popular
idea of the scholar is the musty individual with
high-powered spectacles, his nose one inch from a book
at all times except when he’s eating. But the truth is
that the scholar is the real hero of society.”</p>

<p>“I quite agree, Professor,” Mauney admitted.</p>

<p>“Why! this world of ours is ruled not by government,
but by ideas,” said Freeman enthusiastically.
“The university casts the legislature into shadow. The
scholar toils as no laborer ever knew how to toil,
through painful growth of mind, comparing, judging,
until he gains a new conception of reality. From the
difficult records and phenomena of life he bears forth
his new ideas.”</p>

<p>The eminent historian sat eagerly forward in his
chair.</p>

<p>“Then the new idea spreads,” he said, with a soft
gesture of his hand. “It spreads like the mustard seed.
Like the cloud no bigger than a man’s hand it soon
overspreads the whole sky to give rain to a parched
earth. It is your scholar, Mauney, working in his intangible
medium of thought, who builds up society from
barbarism to civilization.”</p>

<p>Mauney nodded.</p>

<p>“It’s a wonderful life,” he said. “I’ve often thought
of taking up teaching.”</p>

<p>“Well, in that case, you must decide what kind of
teaching. Now as head of our department, I am constantly
on the lookout for young men. We will have
need for a new appointee on the staff this coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
autumn. I am in the position of offering you a lectureship,
if you choose to consider it.”</p>

<p>“That’s much more than I ever expected,” Mauney
replied eagerly. “I’m sure I didn’t even dream of any
such wonderful opportunity. I scarcely know how to
thank you. But I’m very much afraid of my own inability
to fill such a post.”</p>

<p>“We try to train you for your responsibilities,” Freeman
declared, evidently pleased with Mauney’s attitude.
“Perhaps you will need a few weeks to consider my
proposal.”</p>

<p>“No sir, I really don’t need a minute,” he asserted,
“If I’m in order I would like to accept it immediately.”</p>

<p>“Good,” smiled Freeman, rising and extending his
hand. He gave Mauney’s hand a warm pressure.
“Your enthusiasm augurs well and, as I naturally have
most to say about departmental appointments, I am now
really welcoming you to the staff. Of course, the information
must be regarded as strictly confidential until
your name is published in the fall lists. Even Lorna
must not know. Continue your academic work faithfully.
There will be sufficient time during the summer
to prepare you for your duties.”</p>

<p>Mauney’s elation over this incident carried him along
in secret happiness for the remaining weeks of the term.
With a definite purpose in view he took up his historical
work with renewed enthusiasm. Once again, as in
his first days in Merlton, the lamp of knowledge shone
brightly and he lived in great happiness within the zone
of its cool, clear rays.</p>

<p>The Christmas vacation came, with the customary
lull in college life, and he faced Freda MacDowell one
morning, ready for the keeping of their private contract.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
They discussed their plan of attack, after breakfast,
seated together on the dining-room sofa. They
decided to utilize the alcove in the upper hallway, and
asked Gertrude’s permission.</p>

<p>“Naturally,” she consented, pausing in her occupation
of transferring the breakfast dishes to the kitchen.
“As long as you are not contemplating seditious literature.”</p>

<p>“It is going to be pretty seditious, isn’t it, Mr. Bard?”
laughed Freda.</p>

<p>“In that case,” purred Mrs. Manton, “I think the occasion
demands a better setting. You may have the
parlor, if you like. There’s a table you can rest your
typewriter on, and a comfortable couch upon which
Mauney can extend his thoughtful form while he dictates
his words of wisdom.”</p>

<p>“Don’t rub it in, Gertrude,” he pleaded.</p>

<p>“Well, do you want the parlor, or not?”</p>

<p>“You bet we do,” he agreed. “But you may grow
tired of the noise.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s just fine,” declared Freda enthusiastically.
“If Sadie Grote wants to use the piano she can wait
till we get through. Music is only music. But this
book is going to be an event, mind you, Gertrude.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say it wasn’t, my dear.”</p>

<p>“You’d better not, either.”</p>

<p>“Little did I think,” said Mrs. Manton in her low
voice, putting down her dishes on the table, and facing
the two with gentle cynicism, “that my humble abode
would be the scene of authorship. Take my unbounded
approval as granted.”</p>

<p>“Shut up!” said Mauney.</p>

<p>“It’s only what might be expected,” remarked Fred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Stalton, who was commencing his own Christmas holidays.
He was lounging, as of old, in his shirt sleeves,
enjoying the first respite for months. “You know,
Gert, it’s a wonderful little home. It has seen some
queer stunts pulled off. You remember we once harbored
a man named Jolvin here. He evidently drew a
lucky card when he signed on our staff as boarder.
That bird drew a half million touch. There’s luck in
seventy-three. Take my word for it. I’m not jolted
to find that a book is going to be written here either.
I’ll buy one of the first copies. And there’s another
stunt going to be pulled off in a couple of weeks, too.”</p>

<p>“You don’t tell me,” purred Mrs. Manton. “What
is it, pray?”</p>

<p>“Sadie Grote is going to get married!”</p>

<p>“Well, for heaven’s sake,” quoth the landlady, dropping
into a chair and pulling her kimona about her.
“When did Sadie decide to join the ranks of the tormented?”</p>

<p>“A day or two ago. Ain’t she stepping some?”</p>

<p>“You bet she is, Freddie. She’s a sly little fox. She
never told me a word. I’m surprised that Sadie would
tell you first.”</p>

<p>“Well you see, Gert, she owed me that little courtesy,
as I’m the guy that asked her to get married.”</p>

<p>“Fred Stalton!” exclaimed Mrs. Manton.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” exclaimed Freda. “Congratulations!”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Miss MacDowell. I’ll give you an invite
to the wedding ceremony. We’re going to pull it off
about New Year’s in swell style. Down at Belmont
Tabernacle. Got the preacher engaged and everything.
You’ve all got to come. Cheer up, Gert, I know what’s
troubling you. We’re not going to keep house. We’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
going to live right on at seventy-three. There’s luck
in the number.”</p>

<p>“Well, Freddie, I’m surprised at you,” she admitted.
“To think of a shrewd chap like yourself getting married.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t marriage a good thing, Gertrude?” he laughed.</p>

<p>“Yes. A good thing to be through with! May the
ashes of my deceased husband lie perfectly peaceful as
I talk! But this astonishes me considerably.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Manton carried her dishes out to the kitchen
and returned for a second load, in her customary suave
manner, as if, in sooth, nothing however astonishing,
could break in upon the even tenor of her life.</p>

<p>“Wonders and more wonders,” she said. “It won’t
be long until my little family are all gone. Think of
me, widowed at thirty-five, with my children getting
married like this. What am I to do, Miss MacDowell?”</p>

<p>“Why, there’s just one solution under the sun, Gertrude,”
said Freda, seriously.</p>

<p>“What’s that, pray?”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to get married again. You’ll have to
select another husband. Of course I never heard anything
about your first one, but perhaps if you try again
the picking will be better.”</p>

<p>“My first husband was really a prince of a chap,”
she said calmly. “I don’t keep any photos because I
hate to be reminded of what a fine fellow he was. But
if you had seen him you would have fallen for him
at once. No, Miss MacDowell, my quarrel was certainly
not with George Manton in particular, but rather
with the fact of marriage in general.”</p>

<p>“I see,” laughed Freda. “I suppose you didn’t like
to be tied down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>“Precisely the case, my dear. My nature was, and
is, one of those unfortunate ones that doesn’t see sermons
in stones, or poems in running brooks, or eternal
happiness within the confines of a brick residence. I
have never, even yet, reached the slippers-and-fireplace
stage, and have never wearied of variety. I have never
shed a tear of remorse that, at thirty-five, I am not
putting my children to bed, and I was brought up to
love commotion and a life of shifting change. I’m
really a gypsy, you know, I love horses and I love to
be going. My dear husband was a successful business
man with a germ of the <i lang="la">pater familias</i> about him. He
never quite got me, unfortunately. I worshipped the
ground he walked on, but I never considered that my
affection for him should change my home into a nunnery,
nor that I should acknowledge my affection by
living a hermetically-sealed life. Marriage! You really
mustn’t mention it to me. I’m afraid I rebelled against
its restrictions once and for all.”</p>

<p>“Gertrude is rather deep,” Mauney said to Freda,
later, as they started putting the parlor in order for
their task.</p>

<p>“Yes, she is,” Freda admitted. “She has as many
brains as three average women, as much pep as twenty,
and less caution than any I ever met. She really is a
gypsy, I believe. I’d like to know her whole life.—Don’t
you think I had better use this table?”</p>

<p>“Sure. Put the typewriter there. We can have
more light on the scene, too.”</p>

<p>Mauney raised the front curtains to let in the dull,
white glare of the snow-covered street.</p>

<p>“Now I’m going to lounge on the sofa with this
scrap-album on my knees, if you’ll pardon my informality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
and let you have my ideas in straight-from-the-shoulder
sentences.”</p>

<p>“That’s the correct way,” she laughed, seating herself
beside the round centre table and adjusting the ribbons
of her typewriter. “If you don’t go too fast I can
catch it directly on the machine. What are you going
to call the book?”</p>

<p>“Thoughts on the Teaching of History.”</p>

<p>“Fine. What about an introduction?”</p>

<p>“Better have one, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I would suggest a breezy opening of some
sort for the purpose of getting under way.”</p>

<p>Mauney reclined on the sofa and smoked a cigarette.
Presently he dictated, between periods of noise from
the busy typewriter:</p>

<p>“Solomon was right. There is no end to making
books. Why should any modern writer, with surfeit of
literary heritage from past ages, seek to augment their
number? Everything worth saying has been said already.
Every vagary of thought, every wisp of emotion,
every particle of knowledge has been crystallized
in books. It is impossible for any contemporary to insinuate
his thought, however perspicacious, further
than human thought has been already insinuated. It
is impossible for a modern writer to wiggle his pen
in any form of gyration different from the gyrations
of the multitudinous pens, crow-quills and styluses that
have wiggled throughout the centuries. Repetition,
imitation, plagiarism! Everything we write down has
been written under, as in a palimpsest, whether or not
we perceive the dim characters, all but erased through
time. A book is no longer ‘the precious life-blood of
a master spirit, embalmed and treasured up,’ but rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
a craven member of a jingling throng who limp in
tedious masquerade past the grand-stand of a plethoric
and indolent public.</p>

<p>“Books, books! Acres of books, as if a poor, solitary
author could possibly maintain his inspiration in
the midst of such overpowering evidence of ultimate
futility!</p>

<p>“The public have been bored with much writing on
the subject of history, and recently much new history
has been made. We hold no assurance, nor do we
give any, that this rambling communication on the
Teaching of History will do more than limp past the
grand-stand already mentioned. What will be herein
set forth is a description of the author’s sentiments
rather than a didactic scheme, written from the standpoint
of a student of history rather than from the full
knowledge of a scholar.”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Freda, as she pounded out the last
words of the preface, “that you’re too modest. But
never mind, you’re writing the book, not me. You don’t
seem to realize that what the public want is hot air,
not a gentleman’s modest viewpoint.”</p>

<p>Mauney laughed, and sat up on the sofa, watching
her fingers fly over the keys.</p>

<p>“I appreciate the value of hot air, thoroughly, Miss
MacDowell, but I really want to be sincere in this business.
Do you know—it’s great fun writing a book—with
you.”</p>

<p>“I thank you,” she said, dropping her hands in her
lap with a sigh. “Now, have you got your first chapter
ready to commence?”</p>

<p>“Yes, call it, ‘The Beginner’s Preconceptions of History.’
Are you ready?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ever at thy service!”</p>

<p>With a glance at her roguish face he settled down
again upon the comfortable sofa and dictated once
more from the fullness of his heart. They worked hard
until, at noon, Maxwell Lee opened the parlor door,
sticking in his head and glancing from one to the other.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he said, in a surprised tone. “You two
look busy.”</p>

<p>“Indeed we are, Max,” said Freda, stopping her
work. “Mauney—I mean Mr. Bard—is pouring forth
his theories of history, reconstructed, and I, as you see,
am his amanuensis.”</p>

<p>“Great stuff!” drawled Max, entering the room, and
standing beside the sofa he continued: “You old bear,
I’m glad you’re blossoming out into letters, and I’m
glad you’ve got such an excellent amanuensis.”</p>

<p>Mauney glanced from his face to Freda’s with a
peculiar feeling that he had been caught trespassing,
ever so little, upon Lee’s property, but consoled himself
with the knowledge that his relation to Miss MacDowell
was frankly a commercial one, or at most, but
friendly.</p>

<p>“How are things, Max?” he asked.</p>

<p>“So, so. I’m going home for a week’s rest. I just
found out to-day that the sight of that laboratory was
beginning to bore me to tears.” He paused to remove
his overcoat. “Am I butting in?”</p>

<p>He turned toward Freda, as he asked the question.</p>

<p>“I suppose you are, Max. But who has a better
license?”</p>

<p>“Hear, hear!” said Mauney. “Sit down, you prune,
and have a smoke. I’ve just about drained myself of
language, anyway, and I can smell beefsteak frying.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>“And while you two are smoking,” said Freda, rising,
“I’m going out to give Gertrude a hand with the dinner.”</p>

<p>When she had gone Mauney smoked in silence for
an awkward moment.</p>

<p>“How’s the work, Max?”</p>

<p>“Coming along fine. I really think I’ve struck something
big.”</p>

<p>“Gee, that’s good. More power to you. Feeling all-right?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes!” he answered. “Fairly good, I could stand
a little more pep, though. After I get rested up for
a week or so I’ll be right on the job again.”</p>

<p>Mauney rose and walked slowly toward the front
window and stood looking out on the snow-covered
street. For once he failed to understand his own feelings.
There was a hot spot in his bosom, burning
larger and larger. It had something to do with Freda
MacDowell he was sure, because he could see her face
before him with its bewitching comfort. It had something
to do with Max, too. He longed for words, but
they were tied securely within the remotest recesses of
his being. He turned and walked slowly back. Lee
was sitting idly smoking, with his lanky legs carelessly
crossed. He noticed that Max’s face was now flushed.</p>

<p>“It’s a devilish cold day, Max,” he said awkwardly.</p>

<p>“Um-h’m. I think it’s going to snow,” Lee responded,
rising and starting slowly for the door. It was dinner-time.
In getting out the door they made mutual offers
of priority to each other. As they walked toward the
dining room Mauney reflected that they had never done
this before, and that never before, during their long acquaintance
had the weather been a topic of conversation.</p>

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="smcap">The Great Happiness.</span></h3>

<p>The groundwork of Mauney’s book on history was
completed, with Freda’s careful assistance, during
the Christmas holidays, and finished in final form
by the end of March, when the manuscript was submitted
to Locke &amp; Son, Publishers. Mauney was willing
to allow Freda to choose the publisher, having
learned to repose mysterious confidence in her judgment
of such practical matters. He possessed none
too sanguine an opinion of the book’s fate, suffering
from an author’s customary self-depreciation, and was,
therefore, greatly and pleasantly surprised a month
later, to receive a letter from Locke &amp; Son stating
that they had accepted it for publication and would
shortly carry it to press. When he expressed his surprise
Freda seemed not at all excited by the news, as
evidently she had not shared his diffidence.</p>

<p>“Mauney,” she exclaimed, with a hopeless shake of
her head, “you are the most mournful prophet. In
the first place, what you said in it is just contrary
enough to the accepted view of history to stir certain
folks up a little. But I have withheld from you the
real story until now. Do you know why Locke accepted
it?”</p>

<p>“No,” he answered. “That’s what’s puzzling me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then I’ll tell you,” she laughed. “I knew that the
publisher would submit that manuscript to somebody
in the History Department for an opinion. They picked
on our friend Nutbrown Hennigar. Well, maybe you
can imagine what he would have to say about it. He
dictated his letter to me. Of all the letters I have ever
seen it took the red ticket for pure, unadulterated blasphemy.
He told Locke that your manuscript was, to
begin with, merely the asinine vaporings of an unsophisticated
stripling from away back. He said that
your attitude towards history reminded him of a starving
laborer suddenly confronted with a seven-course
dinner. He considers your arguments subversive,
crudely iconoclastic, tinctured by a raw individualistic
attitude, blurred by an emotionalism approaching sentimentality,
that your position could never be subscribed
to by any serious student of history, and that the firm
of Locke &amp; Son would be extremely ill-advised in publishing
so puerile a production.”</p>

<p>“The dirty cur!” interrupted Mauney. “All he has
to do is live on his father’s reputation and crowd down
the under-dog. I’d love to poison that small, squeaking
excuse for a man!”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t think of it!” mocked Freda, with a subtle
smile. “Don’t poison anybody that can help you. Love
your enemies, for they’re useful. If he had contented
himself to praise faintly, Locke would never have
printed it. It was Nutbrown’s loud damns that excited
their curiosity. They thought that anything so subversive
and revolutionary and so tinctured by crude
feeling would sell pretty well, and I think so, too,
Mauney. You did <em>me</em> good when you lambasted these
fossilized specimens of the teaching profession who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
think History is merely an opportunity for displaying
academic methods. You are indeed a very raw youth,”
she added with a mischievous twinkle in her eye, “but
you said a mouthful, for until university students are
shown that history is <em>human</em> they will never take a
proper interest in the subject.”</p>

<p>“I believe that,” said Mauney.</p>

<p>Freda sat up sharply. “Just you wait,” she said,
tapping the desk with her knuckles. “It’s going to be
a great old splash and Nutbrown will be suddenly
seized with an acute pain in his higher criticism.”</p>

<p>“Say, do you know I’ve a secret to tell you,” said
Mauney, after a moment’s reflection. “I’m not really
supposed to tell anybody, but I’m going to tell you.
What do you think has happened?”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps I have an idea,” she said with a particularly
blasé yawn. “But I might be wrong, so maybe
you’d better tell me.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to lecture in history next fall. What do
you think about that?”</p>

<p>“My dear man, I’ve known that for two months.”</p>

<p>“Well, aren’t you glad?” he asked, puzzled by her
apathetic expression.</p>

<p>Her eyes narrowed as if she were weighing the
elements of the case.</p>

<p>“I can’t say that I am,” she replied. “You weren’t
cut out for a professor. Please pardon my abruptness,
but that’s just it. I’m sure you’re happy over it, and
I have no intention of prophesying. My knowledge of
university life has been gained by keeping my eyes
open, and I know the crowd. You won’t agree with
them. You’ re too vital, if I may be allowed to use the
expression.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>“I feel like thanking you for that, Miss MacDowell.”</p>

<p>“You don’t need to. They aren’t such a bad lot. My
first attitude was one of intolerance, but now I pity
them. There they are, up to the ears in thankless routine,
frozen by the currents of pure mentality, no heart
left, lopsided, fossilized, hopeless. I wish I were running
the university.”</p>

<p>There was such frank zeal in her wish that Mauney
inquired as to what changes she would make if she
had her way.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said. “In the first place I’m so sorry for
the president that I could shed tears of real brine.
They put him up in the clouds with a gold halo round
his head and forget that he eats meat and potatoes and
frequently perspires. He’s so busy addressing meetings,
signing documents, preaching sermons and being
necessarily nice to everybody in general that he has
practically nothing to do with the university. He
might as well have an office down town and be done
with it. They expect him to be as perfect as the god
they have made of him, and if he ever makes a mistake
the big howl starts. I’d like to go into his office some
day and kiss him right on the forehead and say: ‘Cheer
up, old chap, you’re a winner!’”</p>

<p>“That ought to help a little,” laughed Mauney.
“What else would you do for the university?”</p>

<p>“Why, I’d cut a great big window to let some sunshine
into the history department. And I’d fire Nutbrown
Hennigar and give him a job as aide-de-camp
to some fat society woman up in the North End. He’s
an example of the vapid young man who gains preferment
solely through family influence. Then I’d take
Uncle Alfred Tanner aside and explain to him that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
can never gain the personal development to which his
noble heart entitles him so long as he submits to the
curbing influence of his brother-in-law’s clever dictatorship.
Then I’d walk into Freeman’s office and, for
purposes of smoothness, agree with him at the outset
that nothing is good for anything, that all human effort
is futile, that there naturally is no God, and then
inquire naively, having got this settled, what he wanted
to do next? I’d like to see that man get loosened up,
just for once. I’ve often sat at my desk and just
simply suffered to foxtrot with him all over the history
department. When Freeman dies they ought to
put a book in his hand instead of a lily.”</p>

<p class="tb">Mauney was reminded of Freda’s tirade against Freeman
a few nights later when he accepted an invitation
to dine at the historian’s quiet home. Of late he had
unconsciously shunned the family, for reasons none
too clear even to his own understanding. At heart he
dimly realized that Lorna herself was the reason. He
justly accused himself of having treated her with a
species of neglect which must have been decidedly
puzzling to her. Her matrimonial decision might have
been arrived at long ago, for all he knew. Although
it was his place, as the lover he had depicted himself,
to inquire, he had nevertheless procrastinated. There
was a great deal of apathy in his nature. He noticed
that, so long as he did not see her or talk with her,
he found no element of his being that regarded her
as necessary. When, however, he was presented with
Lorna in person, as upon this evening, the old attractions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
sprang to life once more, as if her presence were
the essential cause.</p>

<p>He arrived early and talked with her on the rear
lawn while they awaited dinner, which was being prepared
by Mrs. Freeman herself. The high stone wall
at the back of the lawn abutted directly on the western
portion of the university grounds, so close to the
history department that a small door had been cut in
the wall to facilitate the professor’s short cuts to and
from work.</p>

<p>They talked of many impersonal matters. It struck
Mauney as almost absurd that this young woman had
been asked to marry him. The impersonal attitude
into which he had gradually drifted seemed to suit
Lorna well enough, and as he talked with her he began
at last to understand her real nature. Though
pure and blameless, she was so narrowed by the lack
of certain emotions as to be, from a romantic standpoint,
negative. He saw it better now than ever before.
The words that are a woman’s words and never
a man’s, the whimsical details of deportment and address
that belong peculiarly to women, the glances, the
accents, the delicate tricks of wit, the sallies of playfulness—these
were not in Lorna. He knew she liked
him, but her presence was neither warm nor comforting.
Her college training had bestowed, or perhaps
merely emphasized, this negative quality of mind which
Mauney at length recognized and disliked. Lorna
knew that men loved women; knew it to be an accepted
and doubtlessly beautiful arrangement, and one worthy
of emulation, but she did not realize that this love of a
man was no mere arrangement of pretty presentations,
but a vital, all-absorbing, tremulous thing from beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
to end. Most women lived by the power of it:
Lorna labelled it, pigeonholed it, and missed it.</p>

<p>He was tolerably sure that she did not hold it against
him, that he had not again referred to matters of love.
He could more easily imagine her appreciating his
silence. Like her father and mother, her true character
became evident only after long acquaintance.</p>

<p>He had imagined the professor and his wife to be
passably happy together until impressed by Mrs. Freeman’s
constant, mysterious sadness. Whether or not
they began life together in perfect personal harmony
was uncertain. But regarding their present relationship
Mauney entertained no doubt. They had drifted
so far apart that scarcely any common ground remained.
Mrs. Freeman, shocked by her husband’s
growing agnosticism, had clung for refuge more tightly
than ever to dogmatic tenets of religion which at all
times she had held to tightly enough. The farther Freeman
drifted from simple religion the more desperately
did she hold on, until their home life was rendered
a frequent scene of controversial unpleasantness.</p>

<p>At one time, not many years since, they had both attended
church and found sufficient spiritual satisfaction
in the service. But the increasing adventures of
his mental life had gradually wooed Freeman away.
Something of an authority on ritual, he fell to investigating
the subject afresh, to be rewarded by the discovery
of a few errors. These had reference to recondite
matters of priestly vestment and entailed hair-splitting
differences of no importance. It became a hobby.
The investigation led him on into comparative theology
and biblical criticism, the upshot being a declaration
of a position of religious agnosticism. At first he became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
a cheerful pragmatist, then an adroit sceptic,
whereupon Mrs. Freeman’s childlike faith, harshly fortifying
itself, grew slowly militant and became eventually
not so much childlike as childish.</p>

<p>Even an outsider felt the friction just beneath the
surface. Mauney, unprepared to believe how completely
man and wife could be separated by matters of
faith, nevertheless saw the patent duality of the Freeman
home—the professor, ruling his upstairs study and
using the place as a boarding house, while Mrs. Freeman
roamed the rest of the house in spacious tragedy
of manner. The one common ground between them
was Lorna, who, as might be expected, had problems
of tact and opinion to solve. When guests were in the
house she frequently came between her parents in the
role of shock absorber, displaying considerable ingenuity.
On one occasion, Mauney having broached a religious
argument at the dinner-table, Lorna purposely
upset a tumbler of water. This meant a quick jump-up
for every one and was a complete tactical success
since, with the deluged cover tented up on serviette
rings, other topics suggested themselves.</p>

<p>On this particular spring evening, relationships
seemed happier. They sat down at the table in good
spirits. Freeman was apparently satisfied with his mental
progress during the day just finished, for he was
lightsome of manner, disposed to talk in a good-natured
way and looked from Mauney to Lorna with an expression
almost of tenderness. Mauney had never been
made to feel quite so much at home. The fading light
of evening looked in through the large back-windows
of the cozy dining-room like a soft caress upon a scene
of family compactness, where the four, seated at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
cardinal points of the circular table, enjoyed their food
by the rich, yellow light of a centrally-placed, silver
candelabra. Lorna, gowned in a simple white frock,
flickered pleasantly opposite Mauney. The professor’s
face stared at the candles while his wife bowed her
head to say grace. Mrs. Freeman referred to the
younger members of the family as “You children.” It
was all very snug and private and natural.</p>

<p>“Just think,” she said in her soft, slow inflection.
“Another two weeks and you will both be finished with
your college courses. How the time does go! You
leave college halls to enter God’s great world.”</p>

<p>“Now, Mother,” said Lorna, good-naturedly, “it’s not
quite so serious as all that, I hope.”</p>

<p>“We are taught to believe it’s a pretty serious affair,
Lorna,” she responded. “The Scriptures tell us—”</p>

<p>“And the Scriptures are quite right,” smiled Freeman
bitterly. “It is certainly a serious, tragic affair. Personally,
I can’t conceive of anything half so tragic as
life.”</p>

<p>“In what way, Dad?”</p>

<p>“Why, any way you wish to look at it,” he answered
quietly, as he served the dinner. “I think life is the
most stupendous tragedy imaginable, from the very bottom
of the scale to the top. The battle is to the strong,”
he said impressively. “It’s the strong who defeat the
weak and survive.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid,” said Mrs. Freeman, “that Mr. Darwin
will have quite an account to give in the day of reckoning.”</p>

<p>Mauney was not accustomed to such conversation
during his meals and felt embarrassed by the evident
estrangement of the two viewpoints expressed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>“And when, my dear, is the day of reckoning?” enquired
the professor gently.</p>

<p>“If you had been at church last Sunday, Robert,”
she said in a childish, teasing way, “you would have
heard about it from our pastor.”</p>

<p>“He has no more information on the subject than I
have,” affirmed Freeman. “Why should I go to listen
to a man who could not possibly express any ideas or
argument with which my mind has not already grappled?
If there were any such thing as a day of reckoning—which
there definitely is <em>not</em>—Darwin would be able
to present as good a front as most of us. He merely
emphasized a few biological laws which have precisely
the same application to the <i lang="la">genus homo</i> as to the rest.
If I could see one solitary reason for thinking that there
is a God who cares one iota for us and our fates I
might be convinced. But I know one fact for sure—that
the strong win and the weak lose. There’s no argument
about it, people. It’s a fact.”</p>

<p>“But don’t you think, Dad,” said Lorna politely, “that
the weak may win by being wiser than the strong?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, but if a man’s wise he’s strong, not weak.
Man is stronger than the elephant and the lion for that
very reason. He’s wiser than they. His brains have
made civilization safe from the inroads of the wild animals.
He has subjugated all other species to his own
control.”</p>

<p>“And having done so, Professor,” asked Mauney,
“what remains? What is the future of man?”</p>

<p>“Endless labor,” he immediately replied. “All he
can do is to study his past mistakes, profit by them, and
attempt, ever and anon, to improve his social state.
New moralities will crop up from time to time, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
moral standards are evolutionary and are merely suited
to existing states. Man’s fate is solely to move through
shifting phases, through various new codes of ethics
and to dream of a happiness which is always out of
sight.”</p>

<p>Mauney refrained from continuing the argument, for
he noticed that Mrs. Freeman was flushed as she ate
her dinner in preoccupied silence. They tried to change
the subject, but the meal ended in awkward stiffness.
Mauney continued to think of that happiness, which
was always out of sight and that struggle which was
always won by the strong. The thoughts really disturbed
him, for he was thinking indefinitely of Maxwell
Lee. Could it be possible that Freeman was right?</p>

<p>The historian finished his meal in silence. Mauney,
with queer biological insight, imagined the man to be
secretly glorying over the victory suggested by the meat
on his plate. It had once been alive. Man was subjecting
it to the service of his pilgrimage of being.</p>

<p>A subtle chill had entered by the window from the
outside world, rendering this compact family group no
longer intimate friends. They were now selfish animals,
eating other animals, by the light of burning tallow.
And it seemed fitting that the light was so dim
and flickering—all was mystery, cold, impenetrable, and
the great happiness was out of sight.</p>

<p>The two men smoked anon in the familiar study upstairs.
Mauney conversed with his professor in a
mood of semi-detachment, unable to pull from his eyes
a screen that was changing the apparent world to new
interpretations. Even the study was permeated with
the chill atmosphere that existed only in the imagination.
Little currents of cool air played upon his spine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
like horrid fears. The volumes that filled Freeman’s
capacious shelves stood like dangerous enemies against
whom he felt he must be on guard. In the chair before
him sat and smoked a puny man whom Merlton
and a continent acclaimed as great. But the screen
was drawing across him too—a dangerous menace grew
mysteriously out of the perennial smile that played upon
his lips. He would smile life out, this dangerous man
who had conquered existence, and reduced existence to
its bare biological structure. While Mauney sat beside
him the historian’s words affected him more deeply
than they had ever done before. The hot spot burned
in Mauney’s breast, as it had burned at Christmas with
Maxwell Lee. He suffered from its heat; he struggled
inwardly, knowing that even seated in a quiet upstairs
study, his own fate, hinging on the direction of his
tempted thoughts, was in danger of change.</p>

<p>At last it was ended. It was time for him to leave
the scholar with his books. He rose from his chair
and went downstairs, glad to be away from him. He
carried confusion of mind with him to the drawing
room where Lorna sat at the piano, playing. He was
puzzled. He did not interrupt her, but stood near the
instrument watching her. He wanted to leave the house,
for the burning, the unexplained, but painful burning
continued in his breast, and he coveted solitude.</p>

<p>“Did you like that?” she said, as she finished, and
her blue eyes turned to his. In them she saw no conscious
response. “You’re moody to-night, aren’t you
Mauney?” she asked indifferently.</p>

<p>“Oh, play some more, Lorna,” he said, trying to smile.
“Please do.”</p>

<p>He sank thoughtfully into a chair as she continued,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
but he heard not a note of her music. A sadness such
as had never possessed him had settled upon his being.
It was as if he had already gone to the professor and
said:</p>

<p>“I am leaving. I am going far away. I appreciate
all your kindness. But I’ve got to go.”</p>

<p>It was as if he had already gone to Mrs. Freeman
and said: “Good-bye. You have been decent to me,
but something takes me away for ever from your sad
home.”</p>

<p>And it was exactly as if he had interrupted the girl
at the piano to say:</p>

<p>“Lorna, it was all a sad mistake. Forgive me, I’ve
been inconsiderate. I thought I loved you, but now I
know that it was the challenge of your mind that attracted
me. I am going. Think of me as a foolish
boy who did not understand himself.”</p>

<p>In the keen stress of his present mood he had mentally
said these things as he sat near her. Some challenge
of this home had awakened him to a confused
realization of the vital quality of life. What was it?
He could not understand. But he knew that he had
a great account to settle with things. His deepest convictions
had been touched at their source. He wanted
to be up in arms to protect them.</p>

<p>The most absurd thing that he could possibly bring
himself to imagine was the fact that he had asked this
woman at the piano to become his wife. Still more absurd
was his present obligation of chivalry to enquire
now as to her final decision. With a sense of playing
with sacred things, he wound up his courage and spoke
to her, when she finished her music.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lorna, please come and sit near me,” he said, automatically
rising. “I want to say something to you.”</p>

<p>She turned slowly on the piano stool and hesitated,
while she looked in a surprised way from his face to
the chair and then at his face again. She had never
seen the commanding features before. His blue eyes
were severely direct, his brow puckered with seriousness,
his mouth determined. He was not to be denied,
as she could divine from his manner.</p>

<p>He turned the chair for her to sit down and then
when she was seated he quickly resumed his own chair.</p>

<p>“Matters have hung fire long enough between us,
Lorna,” he said. “I want to know what you have decided
to do about me?”</p>

<p>“Mauney!” she replied, in a tone of anger, that
brought a flush to her face. “I thought you had forgotten
all about that.... And I have been so humiliated!”</p>

<p>“Naturally you would be,” he admitted. “I apologize
for what seemed my indifference. You have had a long
time to consider what I asked you, and I am here to
enquire as to your decision.”</p>

<p>“Why on earth be so wretchedly business-like about
it?” she blurted angrily. “One would imagine you were
trying to sell me a house?”</p>

<p>“Again, Lorna, you must pardon me,” he said slowly,
and paused, while he shifted in his chair. “I really did
not mean to give that impression.”</p>

<p>“You’ve hardly come near me since that night when
you—when you kissed me!” She was beside herself
with anger, although she spoke in almost a whisper.
“Do you think I am the kind of girl you can kiss when
you please, and then, after acting coldly for several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
months resume operations once more at your own whimsical
choice? Do you imagine that I relish such treatment?”</p>

<p>“No doubt you don’t, Lorna,” he said. “But do you,
on the other hand, realize that you are a girl whom I
find it very hard to know <em>how</em> to treat? When I asked
you to marry me you replied quite calmly that you
would have to consider the business very cautiously.
Well, then, I’ve given you time to be about as cautious
as you wish. What have you decided to do?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t decided to do anything, Mauney,” she replied
in a tone of complete exasperation. “How do I
know whether I want to marry you or not? I think
it’s totally absurd. I scarcely know you. I know nothing
about your family—you’ve never mentioned them.”</p>

<p>“Why should I? The girl I marry isn’t going to
marry my family—am I to take your answer as ‘No’?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you are,” she replied tensely. “How
could you possibly expect any other answer?”</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, hotly, “there are several reasons why
I might expect another kind of answer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please don’t!” she half gasped, raising her hand
as if his mood greatly disturbed her.</p>

<p>“I’m going to tell you one or two of those reasons,
Lorna. I don’t think I have an exaggerated opinion
of myself by any means, but, at the same time, I believe
my family were just as good as yours and—”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mauney, don’t, please!” she implored, rising,
and burying her face in her hands. While he paused
he was surprised to observe her shoulders twitching.
In a moment she wept.</p>

<p>“I can’t stand this,” she said, sobbing. “I’ve never
quarrelled with anyone before.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>Mauney walked to the piano and leaned thoughtfully
against it.</p>

<p>“I’ll say no more, Lorna,” he said at length. “I’m
really sorry to have upset you this way and ask your
pardon most humbly.”</p>

<p>“All right, Mauney,” she said, gradually gaining control
of herself. “You are pardoned, but please don’t
ever mention marriage to me again. Will you promise?”</p>

<p>“I promise that,” he said simply.</p>

<p>“You know we are both so young,” she continued.
“We were childish to mention it. Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>“I do indeed.”</p>

<p>She came close to him and did a very unexpected
thing. She put one hand on each of his shoulders and
looked up seriously into his eyes.</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about men,” she said with all
the simplicity of a child. “I hope I haven’t hurt your
feelings. I wouldn’t want to do that. I’ve always liked
you. Why can’t we be friends?”</p>

<p>“That will suit me, perfectly,” he said. “As a matter
of fact, Lorna, that’s all we <em>can</em> be.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” she replied, turning away. “Let’s not
be foolish again. Dad told me something to-day and
I’ve been waiting for an opportunity to mention it—your
appointment on the history staff.” Her voice had resumed
its customary tone. “You’re awfully lucky,
Mauney. Dad has unbounded faith in your ability. I
just thought I’d mention it. Aren’t you terribly happy
about it?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell,” he said slowly. “I’m not in a mood
to lie just now. I’m not happy just now. I’m most
unreasonably sad.”</p>

<span class="smcap">Mauney and Freda Have a Talk.</span></h3>

<p>Mauney could not sleep that night when he had
returned to his room. For two hours he tossed
restlessly on his bed when, finding sleep utterly impossible,
he got up, put on his slippers and dressing gown
to descend to the dining room, where the hostess and
Stalton and two strangers, one a man the other a
woman, were seated at cards around the table. Mrs.
Manton looked up at the sound of his slippered step.</p>

<p>“Well, look what God has sent us,” she softly exclaimed.
“If you have any money you’d better get into
the game, Mauney.”</p>

<p>She introduced the strangers.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wright and Miss Wanly have dropped in for
a few hands. Nobody seems to be winning,” she went
on. “Maybe you are the man with the rats. What
do you say?”</p>

<p>“Why, I say ‘yes’ of course,” Mauney quickly responded.
“I don’t know how to play, but I’m sure I
could learn it in five minutes. Will you show me how?”</p>

<p>He drew up a chair while she quickly explained the
principles of the game.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said, picking up his first hand. “I’m
on. I’ve got it cold. Give me one card, please.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” exclaimed Stalton, “That sounds interesting.
Give me one, Gert.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well here’s where I drop out,” she soon proclaimed
as the betting continued. “Go on, Mauney,
raise him.”</p>

<p>“I will, indeed,” he replied: “I’ll raise you a dollar,
Freddie.”</p>

<p>“A dollar, eh?” soliloquized Stalton, glancing sharply
at Mauney’s face. “I’ll see you and bump her up two
more.”</p>

<p>Both the others put down their hands and settled
forward in their seats to watch the game.</p>

<p>“Good,” said Mauney. “I’ll see you and raise you
two. What do you say to that?”</p>

<p>“Ho! ho! The boy is right there!” said Stalton, placing
a chip on the table. “I’ll just call you, Mauney.
What have you got?”</p>

<p>Mauney placed his cards on the table.</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake,” exclaimed Mrs. Manton, examining
them. “A royal flush! Rather nice, too,
Freddie!”</p>

<p>She brushed the pile of money toward the winner
and gathering up the cards handed them to Mauney
to deal.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, getting up from the table. “I’m not
going to play any longer.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” she enquired, curiously.</p>

<p>“You tell me. I’m all out of gear. I’ve been trying
vainly to sleep for two hours. Go on with the game.
Here, Gertrude, you take this pot and play with it. I
don’t want it. I’ll lounge over here for a while.”</p>

<p>He lay down on the sofa and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>“Maybe you’ve been working too hard, Mauney,”
she said, going over to his side and touching his brow
with her soft, jewelled hand. “You’re hot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>She turned for a moment to excuse herself temporarily
from the game and sat on the edge of the sofa.</p>

<p>“You’ll be all right, boy,” she said in her deep tone.
“I guess you’re tired out after your long term of work.
Is there anything I can do for you?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not, Gertrude. It’s just a cranky mood
I’m in.”</p>

<p>“Would you like some coffee?” she asked.</p>

<p>“No thanks. I’m not having any. I’m just fidgety
and disagreeable.”</p>

<p>“I never saw you like this before. I’m afraid you’ve
been taking life too seriously. I know you don’t mind
me talking. Excuse me a minute. I’m just going upstairs
to see if your room’s properly aired and made
up.”</p>

<p>“It’s fine, Gertrude,” he said. “Don’t bother. The
room’s got nothing to do with it.”</p>

<p>However, she was not to be dissuaded.</p>

<p>In a few moments she returned with a folded newspaper
in her hand.</p>

<p>“Did you see the literary supplement of the <cite>Globe</cite>,
Mauney?” she asked. “Well, here’s a half column that
ought to cheer you up a little. Read it.”</p>

<p>Taking the proffered journal he read the portion
indicated under the Book Review section:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<cite>Thoughts on the Teaching of History, by Mauney
Bard</cite>, (Locke &amp; Son, 8vo, cloth, $2.50). It is some
time since so refreshing a volume has appeared, dealing
with a subject of technical education. In style, Mr.
Bard, whose voice is heard for the first time, has
achieved pleasing success. Most technical treatises have
at least a few chapters that challenge the reader’s patience,
but the one under review has apparently none.
It is the work of one undoubtedly in love with his subject,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
and if there are sentiments expressed which, perhaps,
can receive nothing but criticism from established
authorities, yet all differences of opinion will be excused
by reason of Mr. Bard’s delightful affection for history
and all that pertains to it.</p>

<p>“While not acclaiming history as the only considerable
subject on university time-tables, he nevertheless
supports his argument that it is one of the most important,
and shows graphically certain methods and mental
attitudes which are calculated to improve the
teacher’s success. To him, history is not merely a tool
to be used for nurturing a strong national spirit, although
it serves this function, but is, <i lang="fr">par excellence</i>, a door
to the understanding of human nature. Some of his
remarks are worth repeating, as for example, the following
passage from his chapter on the Substance of
History:</p>

<p>“‘History is a record of the conduct of our human
predecessors, considered <i lang="fr">en masse</i>, a record, which, taking
groups of people as its working unit, is necessarily
sketchy and can approach the human past only in fairly
broad outlines. But there is one perfect history. Locked
up in our thoughts, hidden in our bodies, reposes still
some influence of every act, mental or physical, performed
by every one of our ancestors. The history obtained
from books is dead. Man is the living history.
He is the living past!</p>

<p>“‘There is no apology for this individualization of
the conception of history, for it has assisted to unify
the various departments of education which are so frequently
considered separate—religion, politics, sociology,
science, literature. In a university the need is still
great for emphasis on the importance of the individual.
Man, heir to all that has been, claiming all that is to
be, is the real and only unit. Politics is his mode of
mass regulation; sociology, his study of his own relations
to his fellows; science, his weapon of advance
against the frontiers of unacquired knowledge; literature,
his graphic record of experience, and religion, his
visualization of a constant, unattained good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘There is a temptation to the student of history,
wearied by the technicalities of his work, to approach
life more closely than he can do with his books, a
temptation to jump out of their pages into the current
life around him and study the more accurate, though
less decipherable, history to which I have referred—the
individual. Such a temptation, coming to the student,
is perhaps the greatest sign of successful tutoring.
If the teaching of history awakens a warm, eager interest
in humanity, it has not failed.</p>

<p>“‘I have wished, in a fanciful mood, that there existed
a separate history book written about every individual
who ever lived, telling his total life experience.
If one could roam in that vast library he would notice
that few of those histories would boast more than a
page or two, if only historical data were recorded.
But if these individual records went further, if they
enumerated and described the events, the thoughts, the
perplexities, the struggles, the victories, which seemed
great to those forgotten men, then what building on
earth would house that library? Yet such a collection
of tomes would form the world’s most precious treasure,
for such experiences of men and women are the
very substance proper of history.</p>

<p>“‘We are taught wars, revolutions, social and political
experiments. We are led by our teachers to believe
that these constitute the bases of the subject. This
movement or that movement is vaunted as novel or
important. But underneath them all lies the insinuating
power of individual thought. All are formed by it,
promulgated by it, controlled by it. The greatest movement
of this century was also the greatest movement
of the last century and of all centuries from the very
dawn of history—namely, the movement of the individual
mind, by struggle, through perplexity, to a greater, simpler life.’”</p>

</div>

<p>The critical article closed with an optimistic forecast
of the book’s popularity, “especially in non-technical
circles.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>Mauney had been so engrossed in reading that he
did not notice until he finished that Freda MacDowell
was standing beside the sofa.</p>

<p>“Hello, there,” he said, quickly casting the journal
aside. “I didn’t see you.”</p>

<p>“What do you think about the review?” she asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Well,” he replied, crossing his legs and lighting his
cigarette which had gone out. “If you’ll sit down a
minute I’ll tell you.”</p>

<p>She accepted his invitation and leaned towards him.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it just the dandiest review you ever saw?” she
asked. “I’ve been up in my room just glorying over
it.”</p>

<p>“It’s good,” he admitted. “I appreciate the reviewer’s
decency and I feel like calling you my sister in adventure.
You’ve stuck to me like an Indian, Miss MacDowell.
You seemed to—believe in it.”</p>

<p>“How could I help it?” she replied. “You managed
to express a number of things that had always lain dormant
in my own mind. I wanted to say them. But
you said them for me.”</p>

<p>For a moment or two they sat in silence, half listening
to the progress of the game at the table which
was now being played with renewed enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Gertrude told me you got a royal flush,” she said
at length. “What’s that?”</p>

<p>“All kings and queens,” he answered, carelessly, then
asked: “Did Gertrude wake you up?”</p>

<p>“No. I wasn’t asleep.”</p>

<p>“She must be a mind-reader.”</p>

<p>“Why so?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>“Because, to be frank, I was wishing I could have
a little chat with you, but I was afraid you’d gone to
bed long ago.”</p>

<p>“And I was just simply aching to see you,” she
answered. “I brought home the literary supplement
about eleven o’clock and wanted to show it to you, but
she said you had gone to bed. Just how I was going to
wait till morning I didn’t know.”</p>

<p>Another silence fell upon them during which they
both watched the intent faces at the table. Mauney
was stealing occasional sidelong glimpses of Freda’s
beautiful profile, and wondering what might be occupying
her thoughts. To-night he had more difficulty than
ever before in repressing the strong attraction she
unconsciously inspired.</p>

<p>“If I had known you’d be here,” he said. “I’d have
worn—not this dressing gown.”</p>

<p>She shook her head and laughed.</p>

<p>“That doesn’t make any difference,” she said. “I’m
enjoying you in your robes. That’s one reason I like
this place. You don’t even have to dress up your
thoughts, here.”</p>

<p>He was reflecting upon how little personal he had
ever been with her. Together they had spent many
hours working on the manuscript, in strict detachment,
with minds focused on the work in hand. Many times
he had felt the urge to break through the delicate shell
of reserve, but had refrained, partly because he had
wanted to preserve his concentration for literary effort,
but mostly because the figure of Max Lee was
constantly in the background. He knew that his chum
loved Freda MacDowell. He had always taken her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
reciprocation of Lee’s affection for granted until recently,
when he began looking for signs of it.</p>

<p>“But I’m afraid,” she said, “that our dear old
boarding-house is soon going to become a thing of the past.
Everybody seems to be leaving.”</p>

<p>Mauney turned in surprise.</p>

<p>“I haven’t heard a word about it,” he said.</p>

<p>“You knew that Max wasn’t so well, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“He looks poorly, but he has never said a word about
health to me, lately.”</p>

<p>“He’s really pretty well all in, I guess. He’s leaving
in a day or so for Rookland Sanatorium—”</p>

<p>“What! Throwing up his work?”</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“The doctor insists on his going at once. It’s too
bad. Max is such a bright boy. But there’s only one
thing for him to do.”</p>

<p>“You know, Miss MacDowell,” Mauney said in a
low tone, “Max has never been the same to me since
that day when he came home and found you and me
starting the book. I’ve always felt that he was jealous.
But we’ve never mentioned your name.”</p>

<p>“It was very foolish of him to feel that way,” she
replied, with an independent toss of her dark head.
“Surely he had no reason or right to be jealous. Max
and I have just been friends, nothing more. And even
if we had been in love, I would have still had the same
interest in your book. Some people weary me. But
as I was saying, Max will be leaving. And Freddie
and Sadie are going to start housekeeping up in the
North End. She’s raving about their bungalow and
says this boarding house is no place to raise a family.”</p>

<p>Mauney laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>“It looks as though Gertrude would be left pretty
lonely,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” corrected Freda, lowering her voice to a
whisper, “I haven’t told you all yet. This is naturally
confidential. But Gertrude and I have become great
pals. She seems to like to tell me things. The big
joke is that she really isn’t a widow.”</p>

<p>Mauney’s eyes opened in tremendous surprise.</p>

<p>“Where is her husband?”</p>

<p>“He’s been living in hotels in Europe,” she said, with
evident enjoyment of Mauney’s astonishment. “He
left her because she insisted on keeping up a friendship
with another man. Just separated—no divorce.
Well, I think seven years of running a boarding-house
has more or less broken Gertrude’s proud spirit. Manton
has been writing her for the past year, trying to
resume married relations with her, and she has finally
given in. She expects him home in a couple of weeks
and I imagine that will be the end of seventy-three. She
cried up in my room the other night, real Magdalen
tears, and I believe she has learned her lesson.”</p>

<p>“I hope she’ll be happy,” Mauney said. “It’s plainly
another case of false rebellion. I’ve been thinking
about that a lot lately.”</p>

<p>“I know just what you mean,” Freda replied.
“There’s some sort of uppishness about her. She wasn’t
strong enough to endure the bonds of marriage life—”</p>

<p>“That’s it—so she rebelled,” interjected Mauney.
“But her rebellion was merely the hysterical reaction of
an inadequate personality to its environment. Sooner
or later with such people there comes some sort of
circumstance that proves the falseness of their rebellion.
They wilt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>“But on the other hand,” continued Freda, with an
aspect of some inspiration in her eyes, “there are others
who are true rebels. Some of us were made to be
perpetually out of gear with things. Our rebellion is
genuine. We never turn back. We can’t, that’s all.
I wish you could understand me—”</p>

<p>“I do,” he said eagerly, smiling into her eyes. “I
understand completely. I can’t help feeling that we are
in the same boat. I’ve never yet found any kind of
life which completely satisfied me. Take this book of
mine. The fun was all in writing it, Freda.”</p>

<p>She blushed at the sound of her first name. It had
slipped past Mauney’s lips, but he saw no reason to
apologize.</p>

<p>“Nothing suits me,” he continued. “The first part
of my life I lived on a farm. Nothing would suit me,
but an education. Now I’ve got it—and—well, it does
not satisfy.”</p>

<p>He felt great comfort in Freda’s presence, greater,
more mysterious comfort, than he had ever known before.
Most women existed in an unreal atmosphere
outside his own immediate consciousness. Most women
were elusive phantasies of pure appearance, without
content or meaning. But it had so happened that
Freda’s dark eyes were able to pierce the zone of unreality
and stab consciously into his being, even during
the first hour of their acquaintance. It had so happened
that the seeds of that first encounter found exceedingly
fertile soil. His effort to exclude her from his mind
had been just as futile as he considered it successful.
He was indeed master of his conscious thoughts, but
in the reservoirs of his being, this unusual girl had
been living an unmolested life, free to come and go,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
to commune with him in mysterious, unheard conversations,
to mingle her nature with his in hours when his
subconscious self had fled with her beyond the limits of
recognized experience. It was because this knowledge
of her had been entirely buried that he now wondered
at the comfort of her actual presence.</p>

<p>They talked on and on, forgetting the others in the
room, and forgetting also the late hour. Together they
described their common feelings of rebellion against
university education. It was not ordained that either
of them should realize, just then, how vast a principle
underlay their sentiments. Neither of them was to
play the role of interpreter to the other, to explain that
rebellion was the necessary element of progress, that no
man or woman ever changed through the successive
metamorphoses of being who did not rebel against existing
states. They were far from understanding it all.
Mauney, burning with the pent-up indignation of the
present hour, and Freda MacDowell, beautiful and
vivid with the flush of full-hearted reciprocation. The
hours sped. At last the game of poker broke up. At
last the true rebels said good-night to each other and
retired to sleepless beds.</p>

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="smcap">In Which Mauney Calls on the Professor.</span></h3>

<p>Youth is liable to misconstrue the world and its
heterogeneous motives. Being inordinately eager
to fulfil its own pressing missions, it is prone to belittle
the halting advice of more sedate age, and to
battle against every influence seemingly hostile. Youth,
with its mental astigmatisms, is certain to misjudge
situations until it gains the corrective lenses of experience.
It is bound to clothe with over-zealous colors
all that touches its fate, and to defend itself heroically
against encroachment.</p>

<p>Mauney was no exception.</p>

<p>He rose next morning in vast determination to assert
the rights of his own personality, feeling that he
had been spoon-fed long enough, that the hour had arrived
when, not only should he think for himself, but
throw out his formative impressions upon a moulding
society.</p>

<p>No one will quarrel with him for this, since, even
if his impressions were mistaken, a matter for opinion,
naturally, his mood upon this spring morning, the twentieth
of May, to be exact—was evidently the mood of
progress. His pain was the pain of growth. It was
the pain of birth. And birth is the moment of discontinuous
growth.</p>

<p>“All my ideas are due for a great heart-searching,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
a great sifting, a great consolidation. From now no
gloom can be injected into the atmosphere without my
consent. Nothing is true because some one so states.
Truth is what I personally feel, and I feel that, in spite
of the disheartening narrowness of logic, in spite of
the misanthropic outlook of fossilized intelligence, in
spite of all that a university has raised up to alarm
my mind, there does exist a cheerful future for
my kind, and a great happiness that, far away as it
may be, is not quite out of sight.”</p>

<p>At ten o’clock Mrs. Manton came to his room to inform
him that Freda had telephoned from the university
to the effect that he was wanted by Professor Freeman
in the history department. He went directly,
knowing that now with the term ended and the business
of the year settled the department was picking up
the threads of its autumn work. He was to be initiated
into his new duties as a lecturer in history. It
was for this professorial interview that he had been
patiently waiting. He went quickly, with light steps,
down Franklin Street, with eager steps through the
great university square where, as he reflected, he had
stood five years ago, a raw, country boy, overcome by
the aspect of the seat of learning. Much had taken
place. Patiently he had sat beneath the illumination of
the immortal lamp of knowledge, charmed by its radiations,
lulled into a mood of mental delectation. How
often during these years he had crossed these cinder
paths, going eagerly to his history classes, in the fanciful
delusion that God had created a tremendously interesting
world for no other purpose than that students
might glory in their investigations thereof. It had been
a necessary part of life perhaps, but it was all passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
now. “What an innocent dream!” he pondered. “How
unrecking of the dire forces of good and ill that rule
the world, how delightfully blind to actual existence, how
elysian, how stupidly brilliant, how sagely detached!”</p>

<p>But here before him was life. Here was his Alma
Mater—the great stone house, that like a mother took
her children to her breast. Within this mysterious edifice,
what quiet whispers of the restful mother did they
hear and cherish! To-day they came in, children with
plastic minds. To-morrow they went out, citizens of
the world, living men and women who must change
the world. Ah, this was life! He almost paused as
he entered the Gothic portal, with fear of his new responsibilities,
with reverence for his high calling, with
fear of life.</p>

<p>The rotunda was dusky with filtered light from the
stained-glass window above the landing of the dignified
walnut staircase, and duskier with its high, dark-panelled
walls. No one was there—the customary
spring desertion. But, in imagination, there were innumerable
hushed whispers, thick in the atmosphere,
like an overflow from the dead years of lecturing, which,
even now, came back to life once more.</p>

<p>He passed down the dark corridor, lighted by old-fashioned,
carbon lamps, with its dull-green mosaic
floor, its huge walnut doors closed upon empty lecture
rooms. From the open transoms came the imaginary
whispers again. He shivered with thoughts of
their poignant symbolism. At the end of the long hall,
where he turned toward the wing, stood a marble bust
of Homer, with heavy, sightless eyes. Above him hung
a cracked oil painting of some particularly emaciated
celebrity, who had the appearance of peeking timidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
above the rim of his high, white collar, to see who, in
this quiet, deserted hour, might be disturbing the century-old
solitude with his echoing footsteps.</p>

<p>Up the few, worn, stone steps he climbed to the
office door of the department of history. Inside he
found only Freda, seated as usual, behind her flat-topped-desk.
He glanced about to make sure they were
alone. Two mullioned windows on either side let in
the dull daylight. There were chairs, and shelves of
documents, and the broom of a janitor whose labors
had been interrupted. A door on the inner wall stood
ajar, but there was no sound.</p>

<p>He came quickly toward her and covered her right
hand with his own as it lay upon the desk.</p>

<p>“It’s good to see you, to-day, Freda,” he said. “I—”</p>

<p>“S-sh!” she said softly, putting her finger against her
lips and nodding her head towards the door behind
her.</p>

<p>“Professor Freeman has sent for you, Mr. Bard,”
she said aloud, in a most formal tone, the meanwhile
returning the ardent pressure of his hand, and acquiring
a sudden complexion. “If you will be seated,
please, I will see if he is ready for you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, Miss MacDowell,” came a voice from
the inner room, “Dr. Freeman has gone over to his
house. I imagine he’ll be back soon.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Hennigar,” she said politely, but
with a grimace toward the crack in the door.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” he replied, in his English accent, in his
unforgettable voice of harsh, bubbling overtones. “I
say, Miss MacDowell, did you see anything of those
dashed first year exam. books?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>“They’re all here,” she replied indifferently. “Any
time you want them.”</p>

<p>Nutbrown Hennigar opened the door and gave
Mauney a quick, direct stare from his intensely black
eyes. He had never lectured to Mauney and had forgotten
meeting him at the de Freville dinner.</p>

<p>“May I introduce Mr. Bard—Mr. Hennigar,” said
Freda politely.</p>

<p>Hennigar advanced suddenly, in his characteristic
abrupt and shuffling way.</p>

<p>“How d’juh do!” he said briefly, taking Mauney’s
hand, and then dropping it as if it were hot. “Mr.
Bard? Why, of course, how stupid of me!” he said,
pushing his bone-rimmed, nose spectacles further down
toward the point of his nose, and pulling at a black
ribbon that tethered them around the base of his collar.
“I understand you are joining our staff.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” smiled Mauney. “I have been given the opportunity
and naturally consider it a good one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>rather</em>!” coughed Hennigar, with emphasis, as
he took a blue, silk handkerchief from its concealed
position in his coat sleeve. “It’s really awfully good.
By the way, I have the honor to be conversing with
an author, if I’m not mistaken. I have read your
book, Mr. Bard.”</p>

<p>“You did me an honor, Mr. Hennigar.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, not that,” he said. “It was really awfully
well done. Accept my congratulations. Well, I hope
you like it here, and all that. It’s not a bad place, you
know. I needn’t express how glad we are to have you
with us. That goes without saying, of course.”</p>

<p>He swung his left arm up in front of his face and
glanced at his wrist watch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>“And now,” he said, backing slowly toward the door,
“I have an engagement with a beastly dentist and know
you’ll excuse me.”</p>

<p>With a very full, but evanescent exposure of his
very white teeth he nodded his head and disappeared,
slamming the door.</p>

<p>“The miserable little dog,” whispered Freda, her face
flushed. “Just cur enough to fawn. He hates you,
Mauney, like sin. He asked me this morning if I had
read your book. I told him I had and that I considered
it a young masterpiece. He didn’t like me to say that.
He’s one of the poorest sports in Merlton. I’d just
love to push my finger right into his eyes.”</p>

<p>“Freda!”</p>

<p>“You’re shocked! Well, I’ll bet you’ll feel the same
way after you’ve been here a year or so. Sit down
and rest your bones. Professor Freeman will be along
soon.”</p>

<p>Before he could accept her invitation a heavy, energetic
step was heard outside the office. The door
opened and Dr. Alfred K. Tanner’s familiar form bustled
in. He was, as usual, entirely occupied with his
busy thoughts and proceeded straight to Freda’s desk
without noticing Mauney.</p>

<p>“Miss MacDowell,” he said, in a low, intense tone,
leaning over the desk and pointing his plump forefinger
toward the window as if he was about to refer
to the dust that adhered to the panes of glass. “Have
you had time to make out that list yet?”</p>

<p>“Which list, Dr. Tanner?”</p>

<p>“The pass marks in ancient history. The pass marks,
I mentioned yesterday. The pass marks, Miss MacDowell.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, not yet.”</p>

<p>“I see—not yet,” he repeated, straightening up and
pressing his little finger nail between his lips. For
a moment he seemed on the verge of decision. Then,
bending forward again he pointed toward the window.</p>

<p>“Listen, Miss MacDowell,” he said in a very loud
tone. “Delay it. Delay it. I may not want them, you
see? I may not want them. No. I may amalgamate
the pass marks in one lump, Miss MacDowell.”</p>

<p>Then he lowered his voice again.</p>

<p>“You can keep them here, can’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Dr. Tanner.”</p>

<p>“Bully! You keep them here, Miss MacDowell, I
may amalgamate them.”</p>

<p>As he turned to leave the office, he noticed Mauney.
“Hello, there, Mauney Bard,” he said, pausing. “How
are you?”</p>

<p>“Fine, Professor, thank you,” he smiled.</p>

<p>“Did you beat Lorna on the spring exams?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, she defeated me as usual.”</p>

<p>Tanner laughed whole-heartedly.</p>

<p>“Oh—ha! She defeated you as usual. Of course,
she did. Very clever girl, Lorna. Of course, she defeated
you.”</p>

<p>His expression changed.</p>

<p>“Oh yes!” he reminded himself, “I want to see you,
Mauney Bard. Have you got say five minutes to
spare?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir.”</p>

<p>“Bully! Come with me.”</p>

<p>He led Mauney to his office upstairs. Indicating a
chair for Mauney he sat down behind his own desk and
leaned forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, look,” he said, “I want you to understand
that I’m in a most friendly mood. You understand
that, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Mauney, intensely curious.</p>

<p>“Good! I’m really in a <em>most</em> friendly mood. The
professor has already told me that you have joined the
staff. I would congratulate you on joining the staff
except that I consider it unnecessary. I am glad you have
come to us. You are, now, more or less, one of us.
I don’t congratulate you, but I welcome you. You
are one of us, more or less.”</p>

<p>He sat back in his chair and preserved a short silence.</p>

<p>“Now this isn’t any too pleasant a mission,” he declared,
shaking his head, as if Mauney had said it was
pleasant. “I—I feel that, as a senior member of the
staff I should take you under my wing, more or less.
You understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Now here’s what I’m coming to,” he continued.
“You must regard what I say as confidential, unusually
confidential. Yes, I know you will. I don’t
need to ask. <em>Very</em> confidential. It would seem that
Professor Freeman is considerably offended with you.”</p>

<p>“Me!” exclaimed Mauney. “Are you sure, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes—I’m sure—I’m very uncomfortably sure, Mr.
Bard. Now, possess yourself in quietness and I shall try
to make it clear to you—as it is clear to me—why the
professor should be so offended. I, of course, would
not bother telling you, unless, as you may haply surmise,
I am moderately interested in your welfare in
our department. I imagine he will send for you in a
few days.”</p>

<p>“He sent for me this morning!” Mauney interjected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>“Indeed—and did he? Well, I’m not astonished. I
was talking with him this morning and I may say that
considering everything, such, for example, as your
pleasant relationship to the family, if I may refer to
that, in passing, and considering, too, that your record
has been a good one, I say I was taken somewhat by
surprise at his attitude. It has reference, of course, to
your book on the teaching of history.”</p>

<p>“My book—why!” stammered Mauney, quite pale.
“You mean he objects to what I said in it?”</p>

<p>“More or less, Mr. Bard. He feels that, as a member
of the staff, you were ill-advised in publishing a
book which criticizes the methods of the staff.”</p>

<p>“But I wrote it and published it before I became a
member of the staff,” Mauney objected.</p>

<p>“No doubt about that,” Tanner agreed. “I reminded
the professor of that. The fact, in itself, excuses you.
But no fact, as it would seem, can excuse the result.
Now, I am <em>most</em> friendly, Mr. Bard, and am merely
trying to give you the situation. I am not stating any
personal convictions. In one sense, my position denies
me the right to do so. In such an instance, I
really think that criticism is helpful, from whatever
source it may come. I really think that the university,
while doubtlessly far from perfect, has, at least, attained
a degree of dignity where it does not need to
fear, but should welcome criticism. I have read your
book and I am quite frank in saying that it has many
splendid points. But here’s the great difficulty. We
have been trying to run the university under grave
disadvantages. Public sentiment is not always as helpful
and kindly as we might wish. Hence, we deprecate
criticism which is open and militant. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
from your standpoint, Mr. Bard, the problem is to
face the professor, with as good a grace as you can
command, and, now that you know the situation, I
think you will be better prepared.”</p>

<p>Mauney sat staring at the mullioned windows with
the unpleasant feeling of a criminal being prepared by
a minister for the death sentence. This room was the
death-cell, Freeman’s office was to be the death-chamber.
He had committed a heinous offence. He could not
put off the superimposed sense of guilt that breathed
to him from Tanner’s manner and from the ominous
quietness of the room. He told Tanner that he appreciated
his confidential talk and that he was now
“quite prepared” for the interview with the professor,
while Tanner seemed to be struck by a defiant note
in his reply.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Mauney knocked on the professor’s
door, having learned from Freda that he had
returned.</p>

<p>“Come,” said the well-known and pleasant voice.</p>

<p>Mauney found him seated in a Morris chair with a
book on his knee, a pipe in his hand—picture of unruffled
serenity. It was the first time Mauney had been
in the dignified official precincts of the departmental
head, but he could have described the room, so characteristic
was it of the occupant. A simple desk bereft
of all paraphernalia save a ruler, a blotter and an ash-tray.
A wall with two cases of monotonously colored
volumes, and between the cases, an empty grate. It
was severely simple, just like Freeman, whose smile to-day
was as hospitable as ever, as kindly as ever, as
cruel as ever.</p>

<p>“Well, Mauney!” he said, as if no atmosphere of displeasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
were being contemplated. “Won’t you sit
down?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Professor.”</p>

<p>He accepted the only other chair in the room and
avoided Freeman’s keen, grey eyes. He noticed that
the historian’s long dextrous hand was playing with
the ornaments of his chair-arm and that his eyes, whenever
he glanced at them, seemed full of racing plans.</p>

<p>“I sent for you, Mauney, for two reasons,” he said,
gently, so gently that Mauney, for a moment, thought
Tanner had made a mistake. “In the first place I
wanted to mention your book, which I have here in
my hand and which I am reading with interest. Are
you in a hurry?”</p>

<p>“I have nothing to do, Professor,” said Mauney,
more at ease by reason of Freeman’s polite deference.</p>

<p>“You say here, somewhere—oh yes, here’s the place,”
continued Freeman, fondling the pages and quoting a
passage. “‘History must cease to be a subject for the
five-finger exercises of defunct mentalities, and become
rather the earnest objective of men who are in tune
with the issues of current society. It must cease to be
the property of an elite academic dispensing agency,
and become the property of those, who, valuing form
less than substance, will not so much dispense it as interpret
it. It must be rescued from fossilization, as
every branch of learning requires, at times, to be
rescued.’”</p>

<p>Freeman closed the book gently and laid it on the
arm of his chair.</p>

<p>“Do you really believe what you have written,
Mauney?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>“I really do, Professor,” the young man replied, determinedly.</p>

<p>“Then we can better discuss it, knowing that you
are sincere. In the first place, why do you feel as
you do?”</p>

<p>“Because, since the first day I came to college, I have
been confronted by this cut-and-dried, academic spirit
which, to me at least, acts like poison.”</p>

<p>“You mean that, here in our department, there is
a spirit, on the part of the tutors, which is disagreeable
to you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. But, of course, I made no reference to
any university in particular.”</p>

<p>“I know. But, nevertheless, you gained the impression
here?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That is extremely unfortunate,” said Freeman, in a
tone of real sincerity. “Of course, as you must realize,
your book, in places, assumes an attitude of frank rebellion,
and, whether or not you would have written it
had you known you were coming on the staff, the appearance
is nevertheless equally as ridiculous. You see
what I’m driving at?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t want you to be jeered at by the public.
I want you to preserve your dignity as much as
you can. I dare say your book will not actually have
much practical effect on teaching, since it was written
rather as a semi-philosophical treatise. Isn’t that so?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“But at the same time, Mauney, having written it,
you will see how illogical your appearance on a history
staff becomes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>Enmeshed in Freeman’s subtle argument, with its pretence
of deferential consideration, Mauney burned with
sudden indignation.</p>

<p>“There’s just one solution,” he said rising, and now
facing the professor frankly. “I’ve put my foot in it.
I’ve criticized the university. I’ve committed the unpardonable
sin and must abide by the consequences. I
reiterate, without any bluff, sir, that I have suffered
from the dampening influence which kills youthful enthusiasm.
I’ve dared to believe in what I might term
a bright human future. I’ve dared to contradict and
defy the cold, pessimistic viewpoint to which I have
been exposed. Many a boy comes to college full of
ardent belief in the fundamental goodness of things,
but few are strong enough to wade through the marsh
of brilliant tutoring which believes in nothing. I
have been strong enough to wade through, Professor,
and I am strong enough now to offer you, most respectfully,
my resignation from your staff.”</p>

<p>Mauney started toward the door.</p>

<p>“A moment, please,” said Freeman, turning in his
chair. “I think your resignation is the most logical
thing you could give me, because, otherwise, your own
position—”</p>

<p>“Please, Professor,” he interrupted, “don’t let us befog
the situation. You wanted my resignation. You
have it, sir. And let me assure you that I hold no personal
spite. On the contrary I appreciate to the very
limit your many kindnesses to me. There is nothing
personal, Dr. Freeman, in all this. It’s principle, and
I regret that even a principle should separate us. Was
there anything further, sir?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Freeman softly, with a gentle smile on
his lips. “I think that’s all.”</p>

<span class="smcap">The Fool.</span></h3>

<p>At noon, Mauney was too upset to eat dinner. He
wanted to talk to Freda and went upstairs to wait
in the alcove, until she should come up. While he sat
stolidly in one of the chairs behind the little desk, he
occupied himself with turning through the pages of a
book whose title or contents he did not so much as
notice, and in gazing through the window at the street,
busy with noontide pedestrians. He had come straight
home from his meeting with Freeman, sad and angry
and totally impatient. He knew that only one sedative
existed, that only one friend remained to hear his story
of personal woe. He would wait for her.</p>

<p>And while he waited he tried to think, in the distracted
mood of the moment, what he would do. He
had been building upon a foundation, now suddenly
gone. There was nothing—nothing.</p>

<p>Maxwell Lee came out of his room and paused at
the sight of him.</p>

<p>“Hello, Mauney,” he said, a little more affably than
had been his recent wont.</p>

<p>“Hello, Max.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Lee.</p>

<p>“I’m worried a little. I’ve got into the habit lately.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
Sit down and have a smoke. What the devil’s come
over you, Max?”</p>

<p>“Why, nothing, you poor fish,” said Lee, taking the
other chair. “What’s come over <em>you</em>?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much. Only I’m just in a mood to get
this settled.”</p>

<p>“Get what settled?”</p>

<p>“Well, confound it, Max, don’t profess such ignorance.
You know we haven’t been on our old terms for
months and months. I’m going away soon—somewhere,
and I don’t see why we should not part good friends.”</p>

<p>“There’s no reason in the world, Mauney.”</p>

<p>Neither of them thought of smoking, however.</p>

<p>“Yes there is, Max. Let’s be frank.”</p>

<p>“All right. Let’s.”</p>

<p>“I hate to talk this way to you, Max. I know you’re
not well.”</p>

<p>Lee’s eyes narrowed as his glance shifted from the
window to Mauney’s face, but he said nothing.</p>

<p>“I could never talk this way,” Mauney continued,
“except that I could talk to anybody, just now. We
used to be pretty good pals, but that’s apparently over.
We both know why, but neither of us will admit it.
There’s a woman behind it. No need to mention names.
You told me you loved her.”</p>

<p>“Well, what about it?” asked Lee.</p>

<p>“Just this—that I love her, too.”</p>

<p>“I knew that,” he said simply, playing a tattoo on
the top of the desk. “I knew that long ago. It’s no
secret and, well, I suppose she knows you love her, eh?”</p>

<p>“Not yet. But she’s going to be told. I hate doing
anything underhanded.” Mauney paused to look searchingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
at the thin, wistful face of his friend. “What are
you going to do about it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Why, nothing at all. What did you think I would
do—try to murder you?”</p>

<p>Lee rose slowly and put his foot on the chair to
tie his shoe-string. Mauney saw his thin, white hands,
thinner and whiter than a month ago, tremble as he
fumbled the knot.</p>

<p>“Why, no,” he said, straightening himself up. “I’m
not going to do anything about it. I’m the loser, that’s
all. I’m not morbid about it. It’s a losing game all
along the line with me. But I have no fear—none
whatever. That’s what I can’t understand.”</p>

<p>Mauney knew that Lee was thinking of death. There
was death written on his pale face, whose cheeks had
become more concave than before. His eyes burned
with a fire too bright for normal fuel to have kindled.
And Mauney’s bosom burned with pity that he could
not have mentioned for worlds, for he felt that he must
treat Lee as if he were strong. He would have given
anything to be delivered from the necessity.</p>

<p>“Well, Max, old fellow,” he made himself say. “I’m
glad I told you this. I feel better now.”</p>

<p>For an instant the old whimsical smile played on
Lee’s lips.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” he said. “That’s all right, Mauney,
my son, I—I guess I’ll have to be going along.”</p>

<p>When Lee had descended the stairs, Mauney buried
his face in his hands. It hurt. He knew that life was
wringing the last drop of courage from Lee’s heart.
From the window he saw him walking slowly up the
street—Lee, the frail body, the heroic mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>“Am I going to win?” he asked himself. “How it
will hurt to win! Is victory always to the strong?”</p>

<p>Presently, Freda came up the stairs, and walked
quickly along the hall.</p>

<p>“Oh, here you are!” she exclaimed, stopping. “Did
you get through with Freeman?”</p>

<p>“I did indeed,” he replied seriously. “I’m through
with the history department.”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me to explain now. I resigned, and I’m
glad I did. Please don’t hurry away. I want to talk
with you.”</p>

<p>He pulled the chair out for her.</p>

<p>“You must excuse my abruptness, Freda,” he continued.
“But I’ve got to talk with you.”</p>

<p>“What is wrong?” she enquired seriously.</p>

<p>“Just everything. I’m all up in arms against the universe,
I think.”</p>

<p>Life looked dark. He had thrown over, in his rebellion,
the helpfulness of Freeman’s friendship. Vaguely
he knew that the solution of his troubles lay in getting
down to work, some sort of helpful work. But
this was not the only ray of light that began to penetrate.</p>

<p>He had no idea how he should broach the subject
that was torturing him. He loved her dark eyes and
her lips that tenderly tried to understand his mood.
She had been in his deep heart for months. He was
at a loss to know how to begin. He glanced at the
window as if the bald light of the dull May noon were
an intruder. He listened to laughter from downstairs
as if it conspired to hinder him.</p>

<p>“Freda,” he said, pressing her hand as it lay on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
desk. “I love you. I’ve been wanting to tell you this
for a long time.”</p>

<p>Her serious face did not disappoint him. It quivered
into exquisite understanding that brought fine
rims of moisture to her eyes. Mauney could not continue,
for the memory of Lee was making him sad.</p>

<p>“I’m going away somewhere, Freda,” he said presently.
“I don’t know where, but I’m through with Merlton.
I’ve got to find my niche. I’ve got to go away
from you, too. Please, try to understand how hard it
is to go.”</p>

<p>Her eyes softened.</p>

<p>“I think I understand,” she answered, quietly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” he said, with a far-away look in his eyes,
“perhaps I’m a fool. You can’t know how I feel about
you. But Lee—he loves you and needs you—and I
can’t help caring. Why am I such a fool?”</p>

<p>Freda gently released her hand from Mauney’s, and,
rising, walked slowly down the hall towards her room.
On entering it, she closed the door and sank down
upon her knees beside a big chair and deliberately
rested her face upon her arms. She was not weeping
or praying. Seldom did she do either. Her intense
mind was engaged with Mauney Bard. He did not
know that he was being pierced with arrows of shrewd
analysis, that he was being tried in the fires of a woman’s
relentless gauging. Nor did he see her serene face
presently lifted to the warm sunlight that flooded from
her window. Her features wore a new restfulness, for
she had found the beautiful answer to her thoughts.
Delicately the balances of her justice had tipped, to
find Mauney not a fool.</p>

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="smcap">The Last Days at Franklin Street.</span></h3>

<p>Freda MacDowell was one of the most remarked
women who had attended the University of Merlton
in recent years. First as a student, then as a departmental
secretary, she had left behind her a definite
impression on the unchanging portion of the college—the
faculty. Occasionally a student does this, but
never by academic prowess. The brilliant scholar
passes through his four years with lustre of a kind, but
is soon swallowed up in the oblivion of the graduate
status. The remembered student betrays, even in those
budding years, a definite mould of mind, illustrates a
definite viewpoint and adheres to the peculiar details
of conduct that mark a distinct personality.</p>

<p>Freda possessed some unaccountable leverage on life
that bestowed this distinction. She was just a little
mysterious. No one knew why she had come upon the
college world, from the very start, as a rebel, fortified
capably against the acknowledged virtues of a university.
Books were proclaimed a burden, lectures and
classes were boring. Girl associates freely disagreed
with her and disliked her. But on attempting to engage
her in altercation they discovered a handful of
unanswerable arguments. Freda’s tenets were never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
flippant. On the surface they sometimes appeared even
affected yet were found to be based on carefully-digested
opinion.</p>

<p>She never ventured on speculative problems. She
followed her own injunction: “Open your eyes and
look at life.” In so doing she ran the risk of the realist.
Life, too closely inspected, often seems monstrous.</p>

<p>Beneath Freda’s animation and apparent flippancy,
reposed a silent and very solemn tribunal before which
everything of importance had to be arraigned. Themes
of elemental justice, of human motives, and of the obscured
relation of cause and effect—these she dwelt
upon. Few people knew what a sage she was, in secret.
Few were permitted to see past her bright face.</p>

<p>At Merlton, no university student, caring so little
for the customary rewards of education, had received
as much interest from the teachers. Most of the professors
had a tender spot in their hearts for her. This
may have depended, in no little measure, upon her personal
beauty, for decades of mental acquisition do not
alter a man’s response, and a good-looking woman maintains
her authority even in the sedate courts of learning.
Then, too, a realist who has smashed her way
through the brambles wins a sharp simplicity that is
bound to attract all enemies of delusion. Professor
Freeman pendulated between admiration of her mental
courage and curiosity about her flippancy. François
de Freville gloried in his “Oiseau,” without stint.
Alfred K. Tanner loved her, but the great-hearted gentleman
loved nearly everybody, so that it was never
noticeable. Nutbrown Hennigar had started with the
emotionless, but level-headed idea that Freda was sufficiently
ornamental to grace his distinguished presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
on most social occasions and had arrived at a point
where he believed that she should be a permanent ornament
in his home. All these people composed the fringe
of her existence. She took none of them seriously,
but derived a paltry pleasure from the flattery to her
vanity.</p>

<p>A little nearer was Maxwell Lee—so much like her
in many ways, a good chum, clever, sincere and respected.
But he did not awake any amorous response
in Freda.</p>

<p>Thus she had continued to play with life, superficially
gay, but actually discontented. The only man who had
ever believed in her was Mauney Bard. He saw beneath
the surface. This, at least, was how she felt on
the day following his ardent declarations.</p>

<p>Another college term was finished. Spring and the
vacation were at hand. But she knew no eagerness,
as in other years, to be off to her home in Lockwood.
The morning was occupied in arranging her secretarial
desk for the summer’s absence and the afternoon in
quiet day-dreams in her room on Franklin Street.</p>

<p>Her opened window, beside which she lounged in
her big Morris chair, let in a heterogeneous clatter of
carts and horses’ hoofs, the constant, shrill voices of
romping children and the distant melodies of an organ-grinder
from a neighboring block, the brisk movements
of the Rigoletto, and the long, rolling chords of the
Aloha. It was a very satisfactory occupation to sit passively
by her window. Beyond and beneath the noise
and the music there was a sweet silence of new happiness
within her. And her eyes were not seeing the
familiar objects of the room, but feasting upon the
fresh, open face of Mauney Bard. Out of the air, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
clear blue eyes looked into hers. She heard his voice
laughing. She saw his eyes, boyish and eager, light
with their happy laughter.</p>

<p>After a time she glanced toward her wardrobe and
rose impulsively to dress for dinner. While she was
finishing the ceremony of donning a new evening dress
of rose silk the door opened quietly to admit Gertrude
who, after a glance at her bowed smilingly.</p>

<p>“Ah-ha!” she said, very softly, “Doing it <i lang="fr">a la grande</i>,
are you?”</p>

<p>“Gertrude,” said Freda, “see if you can get this fastened,
will you?”</p>

<p>“I shall be pleased, my dear,” responded the landlady,
coming close, “to help you with so charming a
frock. Why a dome-fastener should be placed in such
an inaccessible position puzzles me considerably. Don’t
you want your hair waved a little?”</p>

<p>“Have you really got time to do it up for me?” Freda
eagerly asked.</p>

<p>“Sit down, my dear,” purred Mrs. Manton as she
placed a towel over Freda’s shoulders and began extracting
hairpins. “What a respectable wad you really
have. One could do wonders with half of it. Shall I
give you that Paris touch I used once before?”</p>

<p>Freda nodded, “Uh, huh! Won’t it be grand?”</p>

<p>“Doubtless,” said Mrs. Manton. “But in the words
of Shakespeare, What’s the big idea? Going out for
dinner?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Expecting Mr. Nutbrown Hennigar?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Pure vanity, I suppose, then.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t guessed yet, Gertrude.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re a poor person to risk guesses about,” admitted
Mrs. Manton, “So you may have the fun of telling
me.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said Freda, “I’m in love.”</p>

<p>“In love, my dear!” exclaimed the landlady, “With
what?”</p>

<p>“A man, Gertrude.”</p>

<p>“Never!” Mrs. Manton shook her head slowly as
she stepped in front of Freda to inspect the results
of her handicraft. “Do tell me what it’s like,” she implored.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Freda, “you admire the man’s style
from the first—his voice, his looks. His boots are polished.
His fingernails are clean, and not polished. His
tie is carefully knotted, his trousers well in press. You
like him, but you’re not in love yet.”</p>

<p>“I should say, not yet,” Gertrude agreed, half cynically.</p>

<p>“Then, whenever you talk with him he has a faculty
of understanding you. You don’t have to repeat or
explain, Gertrude. You’ve always wanted to talk with
people who <em>get</em> you. Isn’t that right?”</p>

<p>“It’s as sure as mud.”</p>

<p>“And then,” continued Freda enthusiastically. “It
works the other way, too. You find it easy to understand
him. His broadcasting machine is in the same
wave-length as your radio-receiver. But even then
you’re not in love.”</p>

<p>“Are you quite sure?” enquired Mrs. Manton, teasingly.</p>

<p>“Yes. Listen, Gertrude, to me!” Freda said, as she
rose to look down into the sombre face before her.
“There are all kinds of attractions and fascinations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
and mesmerisms that pass for love. But when you
have known your man for a long time and feel you
can hang on him, trust him, let him steer you, and just
want to be right with him all the time—isn’t that love?”</p>

<p>“It sounds suspiciously like it,” smiled Mrs. Manton.</p>

<p>“But you’re not taking me seriously,” Freda objected.</p>

<p>“What do you want me to do—weep? Oh, girl, I
could deliver one of the finest speeches on this subject
that ever was heard.” Mrs. Manton spoke with decided
emphasis, and pointed toward Freda admonishingly.
“Remember, my dear, that no man lives that can understand
a woman’s nature. They can’t vibrate with
us. Good or bad, they don’t need us. Mind you, they
think they do. But when the curtain is lifted on the
mystery, their fine frenzy dies. What do we do then?
We wash dishes three times a day, and listen to a
voice in the kitchen fire to find out when they will
return to the glorious delirium of their first affections.
Then we grow restless. We are off up toward the
sky. Then we whizz plumb down like an aeroplane in
a nose-dive. We don’t know why we do the things
we do. We are in ignorance as to why our love makes
us hurt them. In short we are women. They are only
men. And a satisfied woman is the rarest work of
God!”</p>

<p>During the evening Gertrude gathered her little flock
together in the dining room and provided music, dancing
and refreshments, as a function in honor of Maxwell
Lee’s departure. Not a word was said about his
condition. It was all as if nothing had happened. Freda
was informed quietly by Mrs. Manton that Mauney
was going to Rookland with Max on the morrow and
was providing money for his better care while in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
sanatorium. He had at first refused his kindly offer,
but had finally been persuaded, after three hours’ argument,
to accept it. The party broke up early and
Freda, after assisting her landlady to wash the dishes,
joined Mauney in the drawing room.</p>

<p>It was a rarely happy hour. Freda, accustomed to
orthodox methods of love-making, was genuinely refreshed
by Mauney’s restraint. Her presence brought
a happiness that he could not disguise. It shone in
his face. Most men would have told her, of course,
that she was looking very beautiful to-night. His
omission of the compliment she readily explained by
reason of his essentially undemonstrative disposition.
Freda, always dramatic by nature, expressed her own
feelings by gathering herself neatly upon a cushion at
his feet. Mauney sat leaning forward, his arms on his
knees, looking down into her face. He scarcely appreciated
the real surrender typified by that lowly cushion.
But he knew and she knew that a delicious, quivering
kind of peace was in the room with them. They talked
of many matters for a time.</p>

<p>“If I had <em>you</em>,” he said, seriously, at length, “everything
would be perfect. I wouldn’t care what happened—”</p>

<p>Her head turned thoughtfully away for a moment,
but he soon lifted her face with a finger under her chin.</p>

<p>“Try to <em>get</em> me, won’t you?” he implored. “Try to
put yourself in my position. Lee has been the whitest
chap to me that ever was. Behind my back as well
as to my face. If he had only ever done me one
little, mean trick—but he hasn’t. Can you see what a
damned predicament I’m in?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied quickly, with an understanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
smile that revealed a white gleam between her lips. “I
can see it, plain as the paper on that ceiling.”</p>

<p>Mauney whistled softly a snatch of an indefinite tune
and made some pretence of keeping time with his heel,
while he stared unhappily at the carpet.</p>

<p>“It’s not very nice to be me,” he said.</p>

<p>“It’s your predicament, boy,” she said, “I’m sure
you’re able to settle it somehow or other.”</p>

<p>Later, when Freda had gone to her room, she was
glad that <em>her</em> lover had a hard problem to solve. She
was glad that <em>her</em> lover was capable of such an unusual
fidelity; for her innate casuistry had been busy on the
situation and had shown her that such a man would
make a faithful husband.</p>

<span class="smcap">Convocation.</span></h3>

<p>Freda returned to her home in Lockwood, advising
Mauney to try for a position on the Lockwood
Collegiate staff. She told him that the town had its
faults, but her father, who was mayor, would be able
to help him get the situation. He wrote and applied,
and was informed by return mail that he would be considered
in due course. Meanwhile he waited in Merlton
for Convocation, to receive his academic degree.</p>

<p>Convocation was an impressive function—the great
assembly hall filled with begowned and mortar-boarded
seniors, and with their admiring relatives and friends;
the broad platform crowded with the professors wearing
their multi-colored gowns, while rich organ music
shook like a solemn presence through the huge auditorium.
After the presentation of the diplomas, Richard
Garnett, the President, made a short address.</p>

<p>“You are going forth,” he said, “to sow in other soils
the seeds you have gathered here.”</p>

<p>The majesty of a university president lends his
words an authoritative dignity suitable to such a
solemn occasion. The graduate, pausing on the threshold
of the world, finds a grandeur in this farewell address.
He becomes inspired to catch the ideal. It is
he who must carry forth the light. He, and his fellows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
beside him in the hall, are to be the torch bearers. It is
an exquisite moment before the Chancellor’s “<i lang="la">Convocatio
dimissa est</i>” and the final thunder of the pipe organ
as they step forth, citizens of the world.</p>

<p>Mauney took heart again. Denied a position on the
university staff, he thought now of those “other soils”
where he was needed even more. It would have been
pleasant to remain in Merlton, adding his moiety of
effort to the distinguished total of a renowned
university. In time it might have brought fame. But the
ideals of Christianity had been rife during the past
four years. No man could go through Merlton
without learning that nobility of character lay in service to
humanity. The courageous, educational formula of
Garnett was responsible for this leaven. It deserved
as much praise and received as much as unspectacular
courage ever does. A thousand men scoffed at Garnett
as a visionary. A thousand fawned upon him for
personal reasons. A hundred knew him. There were
many thoughtless individuals ready to teach him his
function. But there were many also who left Merlton
each year inflamed by his idealism and determined to
serve humanity’s needs. Garnett might have considered
this a tribute much deeper than praise.</p>

<span class="smcap">Lockwood.</span></h3>

<div class="epigraph">

<p>“It is impossible, in our condition of society, not
to be sometimes a snob.”—<cite>Thackeray’s Book of
Snobs.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Lockwood had been called “The Garden of Upper
Canada.” This designation, which scarcely
over-rated the beauty of the town, originated in the private
correspondence of some of its earliest inhabitants.
They were discerning people, mostly United Empire
Loyalists, who, more than a century since, had selected
it for its placid outlook. At Lockwood’s very feet
moved the majestic St. Lawrence, that river of rivers.
Behind it stood the thick forests of an unexplored hinterland
inhabited by deer, bear and cariboo. Through
the town, later on, trailed the long York Road with its
stage-coaches.</p>

<p>A political friend of John Beverley Robinson had
written in a letter: “I have built a home in Lockwood
and here with Bessie (his wife), I hope to remain. My
house stands on a cliff beside the river. We are almost
surrounded by a small forest of pines—cozy and
contented and away from the hot-heads.”</p>

<p>That Lockwood should have been chosen by aristocratic
members of the Family Compact was not strange,
for it furnished these worthy gentlemen with everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
they might desire—boating, hunting, and above all, release
from the trials of politics. “The Garden of Upper
Canada” became an almost exclusive colony for the
faithful adherents of Governors-General. They built
themselves substantial residences, and founded a picturesque
local society. They were the determined rulers
of the state, the ultra-Loyalists, the enemies of Mackenzie,
brothers in a just and elevated cause. Lockwood
in all its beauty was theirs. Lockwood, in spite
of its citizens of a different political faith, was solely
theirs. They were the suffering, but anointed minority,
and the democrats could like it or leave it.</p>

<p>The wealth and high influence of these early settlers
gave Lockwood an aristocratic flavor which never
quite left it. Their motto, “Keep down the underbrush,”
still persisted; although the underbrush, a century later,
constituted the prevailing vegetation. The original, exclusive
set had long since either sailed for England in
disgust at democracy’s progress, or died out. But scions
of that early patrician strain remained. Their homes
on Queen Street East were, in many cases, the very
houses in which the Loyalists had gathered about
friendly fireplaces to discuss death to the hot-heads,
and “jobbery and snobbery,” for themselves. And even
at the present time such fireside discussions were not
unknown.</p>

<p>Freda MacDowell’s mother had been a Smith, a name
adorned by aristocratic associations. Her great-grandfather
had been a full colonel in the British army,
active in the Rebellion of ’37, and one of the Family
Compact group, who had settled in Lockwood. Mrs.
MacDowell could never forget that she had been a
Smith, for there were several things to remind her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
The house on Queen Street East, where she lived with
her husband, George MacDowell, was a very tangible
token of her distinguished descent, and her excellent
social rating in Lockwood—in spite of present poverty—was
an equally pleasant reminder.</p>

<p>The large, square house finished in genuine stucco
had aged to as rich a brown as an old meerschaum pipe.
From the street only glimpses could be had through a
thick screen of pines that filled the grounds and above
a high stone wall that rose like the warding hand of
the very Smiths, saying to the modern hot-heads and
modern rabble: “Thus far, but no further may you
come.” At one corner a large gate opened through the
wall and a gravel road wound gracefully across the lawn
to the house. On closer inspection the building was
seen to be quite large, with its verandahed front facing
westward, and a deeper verandah on its south side
towards the river. As disdainfully as its original owners,
it turned its back on the town to look away upon
the river, where flowed that majestic peace and solace;
while it retained its servant quarters (a long, low wing
used now as a garage), next to the street. The southern
verandah commanded a remarkable vista of the St. Lawrence,
a cool, blue expanse, rimmed by the grey shore
of the United States in the distance, and accentuated
by a foreground of unhusbanded table-land, which
stopped abruptly fifty feet above the water. Wooden
steps had been engineered down the precipitous face
of the cliff to the boathouse, a white frame building
that rested on concrete walls.</p>

<p>The old Smith residence had nothing of the ostentatious
magnificence characterizing the homes on either
side of it. The latter belonged respectively to the Courtneys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
and the Beechers. By their ponderous architecture,
their elaborate lawns, their marble statues, they stood
forth, self-conscious, but awe-inspiring, to emphasize the
plainness of their neighbor. But the older home was well-secluded
behind the stone wall and pine grove, caring
very little for opulent display. The Smith virtue had
been blood. The Beechers and Courtneys were new
people, who had arrived by wealth. The old aristocracy
was rapidly disappearing, and being replaced by a
cheap plutocracy—people unknown fifty years ago, who
now sought to appropriate and maintain the customs,
the very traditions and feelings of the older families.</p>

<p>At present the name “Courtney” and “Beecher”
headed Lockwood’s social list. Both families were tremendously
wealthy, and hated each other for that very
reason. Edward Courtney, senior, who now slept with
his fathers after a career doubtlessly tiring, had made
his millions in Western Canada at a time when property
was a golden investment. He had been a genial,
big fellow of simple tastes, but with a sworn fidelity
to the game of money-making. It was the game that
interested him. At the stage in his career at which
most men would have begun taking out life-insurance
to cover loss from succession-dues he had started investing
earnestly in steel, grain, and what not! Before
he died, almost every important industry in Canada
was, in some degree, dependent upon him.</p>

<p>Beecher, likewise, dead, had amassed his fortune by
a unique combination of common sense and economy.
On surveying fields of enterprise at the time of his
young manhood, he could see that perfumes constituted
not a luxury, but a basic necessity. North America
might eventually stop burning coal, but would never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
demand less, but always more, of the toilet article in
question. He became personally an expert perfumer;
by the use of French names and phrases he cast over
his wares the glamor of a foreign atmosphere and gained
a wide market by attractive advertising. This we may
term common sense. But Beecher’s economy was parsimony;
it was insane fear of poverty. On his death-bed
the favorite emotion of his life surged uppermost,
and, (it was said), he ordered the light turned off to
save power!</p>

<p>Probably, if these two millionaires could have seen
the petty feud between their surviving families, Courtney
would have laughed at its foolishness and Beecher
have snarled at the expense. It cost money thus to vie
with each other. A new yacht or motor car for one
meant a new yacht or car for the other. If the social
columns issued bulletins regarding one family’s journeyings
in Europe the rival family were not going to
be quietly at home in Lockwood to discuss those glowing
items. It was funny. But Lockwood was too obsequious
to see the fun of it, too busy seeking favor
to dare laugh. Colonel Smith, could he have beheld it,
would have scorned it with real Family Compact scorn,
and perhaps Mrs. George MacDowell, scion of her departed
class, may have had promptings to contempt.
Unfortunately she could not afford to heed such promptings.
The new plutocracy had usurped the reins of
social power. Here she was, wedged in between the
Beechers and the Courtneys, accepted on good terms as
long as she maintained the old Smith house. But she
knew that, hard as it was to keep the place up, her
only safe course was to do so. The old aristocracy
now found it necessary to battle for position, and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
chief weapon was a home on Queen Street East. Those
who, by the reason of very limited means, had found
it needful to move from this exclusive residential section
had very gradually been forgotten.</p>

<p>Mrs. MacDowell resembled her daughter in appearance,
save in her coloring. She had the same incisive
features, arched nose and expressive lips, and the same
half-defiant tilt of the head. But she was a pronounced
blond, and her grey-blue eyes were coldly critical. Her
mouth had the suggestion of vast, but well-tempered
bitterness, so often seen in spirited women who know
the importance of continuing attractive under the cruellest
of circumstances. To her credit be it admitted that
she possessed the shrewd qualities necessary for victory
in her particular struggle. She dressed simply, but well.
She maintained her home in simple, but attractive good
taste. Unable to afford servants she managed capably
by herself, and yet her hands remained the envy of
her friends. There was not a wrinkle upon her face,
for she had commanded that aristocratic staidness of
expression that obscures age in those who possess it.</p>

<p>She had, to be sure, much to be thankful for. Her
husband was a special comfort. George MacDowell
was, in her opinion, an example of a type of man that
God no longer saw fit to make. Tall and strong, and
as youthful in spirit as the day she had met him, he
had never entertained an ambitious thought. He was
still the hypnotically attractive chap he had always been,
with his black eyes that could freeze or kindle with
pleasure at his will. He had swung through life indifferent
to everything but Gloria Smith, and his love for
her had been just simple, absolute idolatry. He was
pre-eminently clever and a born diplomat. His wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
accurately described this quality when she said, “George
could tell a person to go to hell, and he would do it
so smoothly that the person would feel flattered!”</p>

<p>If ever there was a case of a woman robbing the
State of a powerful asset this home illustrated it. MacDowell
could have made himself Premier of Canada.
Whatever he turned his hand to succeeded. But the
only thing he had ever seriously accomplished was to
love his wife; and even this, to all outward seeming,
had never been a very serious matter either. He was
always playfully chiding and teasing her. But she was
in command. He followed her wishes blindly, yet with
a dignity that proclaimed his motive. It was not the
thraldom of a weakling, but the conscious surrender
of a giant. This clever and able and imposing man
could have been anything he chose, but he chose to be
only a lover.</p>

<span class="smcap">Freda Comes Home.</span></h3>

<div class="epigraph">

<p>“Tea, thou soft, thou sober, sage and venerable
liquid!”—<cite>Colley Cibber’s, “The Ladies’ Last Stake.”</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Freda, as may be surmised, had no sympathy with
her mother’s frantic social struggle. Her father,
who until five years ago, had been one of Lockwood’s
chief business men, was now idle, and, although he managed
his idleness with remarkable grace, his wealth
was meagre and insufficient to justify his wife’s social
ambitions.</p>

<p>He had been general manager of the Lockwood Carpet
Corporation until a disastrous fire not only robbed
him of the position, but robbed the town of its cardinal
industry as well. That big winter fire had blazed so
furiously that it melted the icicles on houses for blocks
around. It seemed, indeed, to have been the very work
of Lockwood’s pursuing Nemesis. MacDowell had stood
gaping from a water-drenched alley near by. Not until
the large buildings had tottered and collapsed into hopeless
ruin did he return to his home. His wife had
made him a tasty cup of coffee.</p>

<p>“Lockwood is ruined,” he prophesied, and then added
with a sparkling smile, “but this is good coffee.”</p>

<p>His prophesy was true. Hundreds of families left
town as soon as it was learned that the Carpet Works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
would not be rebuilt. The weaving looms had been
operated by steam and now the directors planned to rebuild
in a place where electrical power was cheap. They
offered him his position again, but he refused to leave
Lockwood. They could not understand his stubbornness,
nor the loyalty that made him “stay with the old
town.” He at once blossomed out into the most ardent
of local “boosters.” He assured Lockwood of a speedy
return of local prosperity. “Gentlemen,” he had said to
the Board of Trade, “I could not leave the old town
which has had so pleasant a past, and which will have,
I am confident, so brilliant a future.” To the undiscerning
eye he gained, in his role of perpetual belief
in Lockwood, a heroic character. Each New Year’s
Day he published in the paper a long letter of cheer,
courage and optimism, begging the citizens to be hopeful.
It would not be long until some big industry would
see the advantages of locating in Lockwood. “We
have experienced the mercurial fluctuations of fortune,
but the dead past must bury its dead. Here beside us
is the great St. Lawrence with its unharnessed energy
and its facilities for transportation. Some big industry
is going to see the advantages. Here in our midst we
have the best schools that money can operate, the finest
churches that religion can claim, the highest degree of
municipal efficiency in the country, and, as for beauty,
have we not been called ‘The Garden of Upper Canada?’
Let us patiently wait, for prosperity will return. It
must return.”</p>

<p>Little wonder that George MacDowell was acclaimed
the first citizen. He was made mayor the very year of
the fire and had remained in that office ever since by
repeated acclamations. His tall, serious, reposeful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
figure struck confidence into the public activities. Such
a strong, capable man would never have remained so
long in Lockwood unless he believed in Lockwood’s
future.</p>

<p>And yet the fact was that George MacDowell was
posing all the time. His bluff was such a complete
triumph that even Freda failed to see through it. It
was merely his way of being graceful. Gloria insisted
on remaining in the old Smith house. He would gladly
remain with her and, at the same time, make the
public think that he was inspired by municipal sentiment.</p>

<p>When Freda returned from Merlton he met her at
the train. There was a time when he drove a motor-car,
but of late years it was never taken out of the
garage except when Freda drove it. He carried her
valise across the platform, to be confronted by a mad
platoon of taxi-drivers eager for patronage. They
chose an old hack that had been on duty forty years.
Few other towns would have tolerated the old-fashioned
vehicle with its low, commodious seat, the extravagantly
graceful curves of its body, its weather-beaten varnish
and its quaint side-lamps of brass, designed like the
wall-torches of a baronial castle. In most neighboring
towns, more imbued with a spirit of progress, this picturesque
conveyance would have been relegated long
since to some backyard, or broken up for fuel. But
Lockwood possessed a conservative cult who admired
the symbols of leisure. This antiquated hack frequently
moved down Station Street filled with the town’s
elite, making no attempt to keep pace with the motors
that rushed madly ahead, angry at having to return
empty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t see a single vacant house, Dad,” remarked
Freda, as they started along Station Street.</p>

<p>“Nor do I by gad,” replied her father. “Lockwood is
filling up, but with a rummy bunch of people. These
houses should be tenanted by industrious workmen. Instead
they are occupied by retired shopkeepers, farmers
and clergymen from the country districts.”</p>

<p>“Why do you call ’em rummy?” Freda inquired.</p>

<p>“Cause they <em>are</em> rummy, Freda. They’re no good to
the town. They retired before the war on enough to
keep ’em at six per cent. To-day, even at seven and a
half, they’re swamped by increasing taxation and the
H.C.L. They’re the growlers. Did you hear about the
school fracas?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear; no!”</p>

<p>“Interested?”</p>

<p>“Terribly.”</p>

<p>“Good! The school was overcrowded; they were
holding classes in the basement. Henry Dover came
to me and asked if I thought the collegiate could be
enlarged. Said he had eleven teachers now and needed
room. Did I think it could be done? I said it was
as plain as the nose on his face. It <em>had</em> to be done
or we’d lose the pupils. But when the Board of Education
put it to a vote—wow! What a wail from the
retired element! Motion defeated, of course!”</p>

<p>“But you can’t blame them, Dad.”</p>

<p>“No. Admitted! I don’t blame them.”</p>

<p>Presently, as they turned upon Queen Street, MacDowell
made a gesture toward the spectacle of broad,
tarvia pavement, bulwarked on both sides with cluster
lamps and high brick shops.</p>

<p>“Where will you find a better looking main street?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
he asked, almost automatically. “And, do you know,
our population, by the latest census, shows an increase
of three?”</p>

<p>“Oh, surely, not just three!” exclaimed Freda.</p>

<p>“Why, that’s good,” said MacDowell, with a lurking
smile of cynicism that his daughter did not notice.
“We’re not growing very rapidly. <em>But just you wait.</em>
One of these days some big concern is going to see
the advantages of locating in Lockwood. As electric
power is developed we’re going to get the advantage.
Think of that river! Some day we’ll be a city. <em>Just
you wait!</em>”</p>

<p>Lockwood had already been waiting for half a century.
Freda had heard her father’s words so often
that she knew them by heart: “One of these days
some big concern—” And her heart that knew the
words so well caught her with needless pity for the
man she considered so incurably optimistic.</p>

<p>When the hack arrived at their home, Freda was not
in the least surprised to discover an afternoon tea in full
progress on the rear verandah. She knew just how essential
afternoon teas were in Queen Street East, but
she could not suppress a certain impatience.</p>

<p>“Heavens, mother is right at the post of duty!” she
exclaimed as they drove up near the verandah. “Apparently
the home-coming of the prodigal daughter
has caused a feast to be set!”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” chuckled MacDowell, good-naturedly.
“Your mother never liked your staying at that place
on Franklin Street and probably will never forgive you.
But she’s glad to see you just the same.”</p>

<p>“Mother is a woman of one idea,” sighed Freda.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>“Course she is,” he laughed. “She had planned this
tea before she knew when you were coming.”</p>

<p>Mrs. MacDowell gracefully left the verandah to greet
Freda with a kiss, and then led her straight back to
her guests. Most of them had a word of welcome,
with the exception of Mrs. Courtney, who contributed
merely a stiff, little nod of her silver-grey head. It
was just like Freda to accept this as a challenge. She
paused and directed her most obsequious attentions
upon the wealthy widow who had long been a thorn in
her flesh.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Courtney,” she said, extending her hand
with feigned good-will and adopting at once a Lockwood
type of afternoon-tea formality, “How awfully
well you look! Are you playing much golf this summer?”</p>

<p>“Child, you <em>know</em> I never play golf,” responded Mrs.
Courtney, with evident ill-relish.</p>

<p>“Oh, of course, not. How stupid of me! You must
forgive me! I was thinking of Mrs. Beecher.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtney flushed and glanced sharply at Freda
who, wreathed in smiles, bowed to the others and went
into the house. The arrow had found its mark. In
the first place, the huge figure of Mrs. Courtney playing
golf would have made a screamingly funny and grotesque
cartoon. But to be confused in any way whatsoever
with her social enemy, Mrs. Beecher, was an
unforgivable mistake.</p>

<p>“I do wish,” remarked Mrs. MacDowell, caustically,
while she and Freda were later engaged with washing
the dinner dishes, “that you would try to use a slight
degree of sense. Your <i lang="fr">faux pas</i> this afternoon offended
Mrs. Courtney, visibly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dear heavens,” laughed Freda, so heartily that she
had to drop into a chair; “I’m glad if it did, Mother.
She’s one of the most exalted persons I ever heard of.”</p>

<p>“And you, my girl, are one of the most reckless,”
quickly rejoined her mother.</p>

<p>“Do you remember,” asked Freda, “how miserable
she made things for me about six years ago when she
was afraid that I was going to get her darling young
Teddie?”</p>

<p>“I do, indeed, Freda.”</p>

<p>“How she cut me, more than once?”</p>

<p>“I remember it, quite,” nodded Mrs. MacDowell.
“But such revenge as yours is merely senseless.”</p>

<p>“You think I ought to be more thorough-going, do
you?” asked Freda. “Perhaps you think a better revenge
would be to marry Ted Courtney, even yet—”</p>

<p>Mrs. MacDowell cast a long, steady look at Freda,
a look full of her grey-eyed criticism, full of her tranquil-faced
reserve, full of her Family-Compact self-sufficiency;
but she said not a word more.</p>

<div class="epigraph">

<p>“He is a father to the town.”—<cite>Latin Proverb.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>After dinner, Freda was left suddenly alone. Her
mother was up the river at a bridge party on
Courtney’s elegant yacht, the <i>Cinderella</i>. Her father
was at home, but she felt that after her year’s absence
it would be necessary to become acquainted with him
again. When he finished his paper, he strolled with
her about the wide lawn, asking many questions about
her work in Merlton. He was very impersonal and
almost polite and, although Freda was sure he was not
much interested in her work, she admired his consummate
smoothness. During all the years of her grown-up
life he had been just as impervious and just as
winningly polished as to-night. She felt the same attraction
as if she were talking with any cultivated and
gentlemanly stranger.</p>

<p>“It must be nice, Dad, to be the whole cheese in this
town,” she said, teasingly.</p>

<p>“If you’re referring to me,” he replied, “I’ll enquire—before
thanking you for the compliment—whether or
not you’re seeking municipal favor?”</p>

<p>“Not for myself, but for somebody else,” she answered
quickly.</p>

<p>“Who on earth?”</p>

<p>“Will you promise to do something for me?” she
asked, taking his arm prettily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I guess so,” he smiled.</p>

<p>“No matter what I ask?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I promise.”</p>

<p>“Listen, Dad, to me,” she said, stopping and looking
up into his big, curious, black eyes. “If a young gentleman
named Mauney Bard tries to get on the collegiate
staff will you tell Henry Dover that he’s one of
the brightest boys in Canada, and will you put in a
good word with the Board of Education?”</p>

<p>“What’s his name?”</p>

<p>“Mauney Bard.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll do it,” agreed MacDowell. “Hum!
Brightest boy in Canada, is he? That’s going some.
Who is this Mauney Bard?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just a nice chap who boarded at Franklin Street
with me.”</p>

<p>“You’re always given to exaggeration, if I may so
express myself,” he smiled. “I suppose when you get
it all boiled down, Mauney Bard is just a man after
a job.”</p>

<p>“No, no, you’re all wrong, Dad. He’s more than
that—I’m in love with him.”</p>

<p>“Who? Mauney Bard?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said MacDowell, complacently. “You’ve
been in love before now.”</p>

<p>“You’re wrong again, Dad,” she replied. She wanted
to tell her father—or somebody—how she felt about
Mauney, but her father’s interest seemed only casual.
Freda consequently remained silent and became very
unhappy. That silence and unhappiness of Lockwood
would always arrive sooner or later. To-night was
typical of her home—her mother off to a game of cards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
and her father chatting just as any interesting, but
total, stranger might do.</p>

<p>Lockwood always caused a little flutter in her heart
and then a depression. Her mother’s social ambition
had constituted a problem which she had solved only
by leaving home. Fawning upon the plutocracy was,
without exception, the most disgusting practice of which
Freda could conceive.</p>

<p>“Are we always going to go on living in this hide-bound
community, Dad?” she asked, as they strolled
together. “I hate it just like snakes. I could murder
that Mrs. Courtney and the whole raft of them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they’ re all right as far as they go,” he replied
lightly, “The Courtneys, Turnbulls, Beechers, Squires
and that ilk don’t help Lockwood much. They don’t
spend their money here. This is only a pivot for
them. They’re off to California, Honolulu or Europe
half the time. And they don’t want industries here—they’re
afraid of the coal smoke. But, never mind!
They won’t always run the town. Some day some
big concern is going to see the—”</p>

<p>“Some day,” Freda said, seriously, “you and I, Dad,
are both going to be dead. Why can’t we leave Lockwood
and live in Merlton?”</p>

<p>“Simply because,” he replied firmly, “we’re not going
to forsake the old town. That would be unfaithful.”
His black eyes flashed with concealed amusement.
“Lockwood will be a city some day. It’s bound
to be. Just you wait!”</p>

<p>Freda was deliciously impatient and vexed and sad
when she retired that night. From her bed, she gazed at
the grey St. Lawrence out under the cliff, and realized
at length that she was already lonesome for Mauney.</p>

<h3 id="IV_CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="smcap">Mauney Meets Mrs. MacDowell.</span></h3>

<p>When Mauney arrived in Lockwood, on his way
home, he completed certain reflections which
had occupied him most of the day by deciding not to
call upon Freda. But he found that his brother William,
who had driven in for him from Lantern Marsh,
had still some shopping to do before returning, and
he made up his mind to stroll down Queen Street
East, past her home. This little walk had the effect
of making him quite unhappy. First of all he passed
the Armouries, which recalled his unsuccessful attempt
to enlist, eight years ago. In the associations of
that memory there was bitterness which still troubled
him. In the second place, although he had Freda’s
street number, he could not find her house until he
made the enquiry of an officious nurse-maid who pushed
her baby-carriage no less haughtily than she pointed
out the MacDowell residence. He stood still and gazed
confusedly at the high stone wall and the forbidding
gateway. Was there not some mistake? He had not
thought of Freda as belonging to so grand a home.
His perplexity, combined with a self-conscious sense
of his own ill-groomed appearance after the train
journey, strengthened his determination not to call.</p>

<p>It was hard to forego seeing her. Her house and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
his clothes, however, had little to do with it. The real
obstacle was Lee. Why must he consider his old
friend so much? Why should Lee’s attachment to
Freda, unreciprocated and hopeless, have any influence?
Mauney had labored these questions all day, and he
had discovered the only possible answer. It was because
he himself was constituted as he was.</p>

<p>On his way back to meet his brother in the centre
of the town, he kept rehearsing his argument. He
wished that he possessed enough indifference to Lee to
disregard him. The present situation was characteristic
of life as he had learned to know it. Never yet
had he longed greatly for anything, but he must face
obstacles apparently insuperable. Just now it was his
respect for Maxwell Lee that held him back. Lee had
not mentioned Freda during the trip to Rockland, but
then, Max never mentioned anything that he felt keenly.
He even omitted to thank Mauney for his kindness
in providing help at a crucial moment.</p>

<p>The only course that Mauney could consider was
to wait for events. If Lee recovered, there would no
longer be any obstacle in the path that led him to Freda.
If he died, the way was even clearer. But it might be
months before either fate, and, in the meantime,
Mauney determined to be towards Freda friendly at
most.</p>

<p>He had not been home many days when a letter of
acceptance came from the Lockwood Board of Education,
and another letter from the collegiate principal,
Henry Dover, requesting an early interview. He drove
to town in William’s motor-car and spent an hour with
Dover at the school, gaining some idea of his work,
which was to begin in September.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he paid a call at MacDowell’s, which he was
not soon to forget. Freda’s mother answered the door
and, as she heard his name, favored him with a long,
rude, critical stare that gradually shaded into a supercilious
smile as she turned away without a word, leaving
him standing in the doorway. Freda chanced to
be in the library, close enough apparently to grasp the
situation, for she came out at once, speaking calmly,
to be sure, but with cheeks a flaming crimson. Mauney,
to whom such an encounter was a new experience, was,
for a time, too stunned to talk much.</p>

<p>“I’ve been expecting you for days,” Freda said, leading
him to the farther verandah and arranging chairs.
“Sit down and rest your weary bones, won’t you? Tell
me all about what you’ve been doing. Aren’t you going
to talk?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied slowly, “I expect to say a few
words; but may I enquire if it was your mother who
came to the door?”</p>

<p>“Oh, please don’t mind her, Mauney,” said Freda,
awkwardly. “You see, mother is quite unreasonable
about some things. I’ll explain that all, some day. Tell
me—any word about the school?”</p>

<p>While he was talking she sat wondering what difference
she noticed in him. He had altered somehow. The
smile of his eyes was gone. There was something stubbornly
immovable about his big body as he sat with legs
crossed and arms folded on his chest, and his eyes
only glanced at her before they turned away sadly,
as she thought.</p>

<p>“Freda,” he said after a pause. “I can’t place you
in this house. There’s some mistake.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>“How do you mean?” she asked with an expression
of great interest.</p>

<p>“You won’t mind me being frank?”</p>

<p>“Not one particle, Mauney.”</p>

<p>He unfolded his arms and leaned slowly forward,
rubbing his cheek with his hand.</p>

<p>“I never knew I could get so darned worked up over
a little thing,” he said, testily. “Your mother froze
me in there. I’m beginning to think, Freda, that I
can feel just about as snobbish as she does.”</p>

<p>“You said it, Mauney,” she whispered. “I’ve no
sympathy at all for her. Please try to grasp that point
right now. I told her about you, and she’s just been
waiting to make you feel unwelcome.”</p>

<p>“She’s succeeded, too.”</p>

<p>“She succeeds in everything, but managing me,”
Freda went on warmly. “Oh, I can’t, simply can’t
tell you what I’ve had to put up with, Mauney. I don’t
feel one-half as much at home here as I did at Gertrude’s.
Listen. My mother—and I’m sorry I have to
say it—is an inexcusable snob from the word go. Her
ideas aren’t any more like mine than day is like night.
So you can understand why I don’t spend much time in
Lockwood.”</p>

<p>“Are you going back to Merlton this fall?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>Mauney regarded her in silence for a moment, as
their eyes met and did not waver.</p>

<p>“My God, Freda, you’re a comfort,” he said suddenly.
With a little laugh he rose and picked up his
hat from the table. “I’ve got to be going.”</p>

<p>“And don’t forget,” she said, as she walked beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
him to the car, “that there will be somebody here waiting
to see you again, soon.”</p>

<p>“I’m not likely to forget it,” he said, giving her arm
a gentle pinch. “The fact is, nothing else much suits
me, but being around where you are.”</p>

<p>That evening, after Freda had washed the dinner
dishes, she remained thoughtfully busy in the kitchen.
Presently her mother, as she had been expecting, came
out to prepare some grape-fruit for the breakfast, and
incidentally, to pass a few remarks about Mauney. She
had sunk the blade of her knife into the green fruit
before she glanced up to behold Freda, who, in accordance
with old custom, was sitting perched on the back
of a kitchen chair with her feet resting on its seat.
With a thin sigh that expressed her disapproval of the
posture, Mrs. MacDowell took up a pair of scissors
and proceeded with her work.</p>

<p>“Has it ever occurred to you,” she commenced, in
a delicately scornful tone, “that this Bard person is a
rather stiffish youth?”</p>

<p>“He’s stiffish all right enough, Mother,” said Freda
with an amused chuckle. “I used to always fall for
the foppish variety, didn’t I? But I’m getting old,
and my taste in men is changing.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure, but that he’s related to the Bards
of Beulah, who bring turnips to the market,” submitted
her mother, calmly, as she snipped away with her scissors.</p>

<p>“I imagine you’re quite right,” Freda said. “Mauney
has hoed ’em himself lots of times, and is proud of it.”</p>

<p>“He seems to have practically no social address, no
ease of manner.”</p>

<p>“I fancy he’ll carry away an equal contempt for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
yours. Was that your highest code of manners you
were practising on him? As for social address—you’re
right. He wasn’t around when they were handing
that stuff out. He has never had his spine manicured!”</p>

<p>“Spine!” Mrs. MacDowell scoffed very gently.
“What a delightful Franklin Street vocabulary you
have acquired! As long as I care to remember, you
have never been willing to listen to a word from me.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mother, you never said a word that appealed
to me. That’s why.”</p>

<p>Freda rapped with her toes in an aggravating tattoo
on the chair seat, and then began teetering back and
forth in such a way that the front legs kept dropping
noisily against the floor. Mrs. MacDowell worked on
quietly for a few moments.</p>

<p>“Freda,” she said at length, without looking up, “I
sincerely wish that you, some time or other, will gratify
a long-cherished desire of mine by falling flat off
that confounded chair.”</p>

<p>“And cracking my skull, I suppose,” added Freda,
the meanwhile balancing skilfully on the two back legs.
“Well, this is my favorite sport, and it’s worth a skull
any time. Do you know, Mother, I’ve a good notion
not to go back to Merlton this fall.”</p>

<p>Mrs. MacDowell did not at once reply.</p>

<p>“That is almost the brightest idea that has emerged
from your skull since you came home,” she said presently,
in a tone of sarcasm. “How would you propose
to amuse yourself in Lockwood?”</p>

<p>“I could get a job as private secretary to Ted Courtney.
Ted needs somebody to help him look after his
money. I was talking to him on the street last night,
and asked him if he could give me a job. He jumped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
right at the idea like a bulldog. Says he’s needed some
one for a long time, and, I may say, he offers me a
splendid proposition. I said I’d have to take a few
days to consider it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. MacDowell gazed on Freda with the expression
of one who has learned by experience to credit
even the most preposterous of her daughter’s statements.
“I trust,” she interrupted seriously, “that there
is no truth in what you are saying.”</p>

<p>“Get me a Bible, then,” replied Freda. “I suppose
the idea of me working for a Courtney is about the
same to you, Mother, as a long drink of twenty percent.
Paris Green.”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s so absurd!” mused Mrs. MacDowell, “so
utterly absurd!”</p>

<p>“You mean humiliating, don’t you?” asked Freda,
tapping thoughtfully now with her toes. “There used
to be a time when social position depended on brains,
ability, blood, and such personal things. That’s so
long ago that Herodotus would have to scratch his
dome to remember it. Right now, it depends on how
one’s daughter spends her time. If I could float around
in a new Packard roadster with a Pekinese pup sitting
on a blue cushion beside me, why your dear, old prestige
would be as safe as the Bank of England. But
I’ve got imbued, Mother, with the thoroughly low-brow
idea that a woman of my age—of any age for that matter—is
better when she’s at work.”</p>

<p>“And I’m quite sure,” said Mrs. MacDowell, with
considerable emphasis, “that your reason for wishing
to stay in Lockwood is merely to be near our young
turnip-digger.”</p>

<p>Freda’s face flushed, but she disregarded the reference.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
“I shouldn’t be at all surprised, Mother,” she
replied with a growing warmth, “if that had something
to do with it. But there is also another reason. I’ve
just simply ached, these last six years, to enjoy a little
home life, undisturbed, and you’ve given me no chance.
I come home and all the time either you are away off
somewhere, or else so surrounded by a bunch of
darned fools that I never see you.”</p>

<p>“That’s <em>quite</em> enough!” commanded Mrs. MacDowell.
“Surely you’re growing irresponsible.”</p>

<p>Freda’s face was crimson and her eyes flashing with
a dangerous light. She tried to swallow something
that stuck in her throat. Her mother knew these symptoms
well enough. They meant rage. They meant
that Freda must be left alone for the balance of the
evening.</p>

<p>Several minutes after Mrs. MacDowell had gone her
husband sauntered into the kitchen, to find his daughter
sitting in the same position, but with her face in her
hands.</p>

<p>“You women folk astonish me,” he laughed. “There’s
nothing in it, Freda; nothing in it. Your mother is a
Smith, remember. Enough said. She’s different.
There’s nothing in it at all, by gad!”</p>

<h3 id="IV_CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smcap">A Summer at Home.</span></h3>

<p>Until the present summer Mauney had never gone
back to the farm at Lantern Marsh, so that now,
with his new mental outlook, he was for the first time
enjoying it. William was living on his father’s place
and renting the old McBratney property to an Englishman.
Time had brought about changes. William was
no longer the insupportable person he had once been.
His wife Evelyn had adapted herself, cheerfully, to her
circumstances. She found no time now to indulge her
former love of gramophones and motoring. The two
were living happily together, while the wonted sombreness
of the old home was gratefully relieved by the
shrill voices of two healthy children. William, once
the scoffer, was now proud of his brother, while
Mauney had learned a tolerance that made William’s
bad English even lovably picturesque.</p>

<p>“Well, Maun,” William would say, “you’ve got the
book learning fer the hull crowd. But while you’ve
been a-studyin’ I’ve been raisin’ a family, an’ there ain’t
no good o’ us two tryin’ to argue which is the best. But
I’ll take the family every time!”</p>

<p>Then Mauney would laugh and reply, “There’s nothing
like being happy, Bill, whatever you have to do to
get there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>He felt that he himself was very gradually arriving.
Ahead lay the treasures of history to be expounded to
a new generation. With his own hands he was to lift
before their eyes the ideals which he had won. It
took no more than this glorious prospect to make him
very content.</p>

<p>There was sadness, though, in every memory of Lantern
Marsh. Time after time during the summer
months, thoughts rushed unbidden upon him to shake
his being—those family sentiments of past scenes,
pathetic differences of opinion, once so important, but
now so irrevocable and small. The eye of retrospect
sees with a tender sight. Mauney kept fancying that
his father’s big form must soon appear at the lane entrance
carrying a whiffletree, or his harsh voice be
heard swearing at his horses. The man had lived up
to his light. Experience forgave him his faults. But
now Seth Bard, with all his gruffness and strength,
was silent and vanished. Once he had seemed the most
immovable body on earth, the one great, availing magnitude.
But even the winds that blew from unseen
quarters across the desolate marsh were more enduring
than he.</p>

<p>And Mauney’s sadness found a strange kind of comfort
as he gazed upon that never-ending swamp. It
had been there always. Since he had known anything
he had known that swamp—bleak and horrid and fascinating,
as changing as the phases of his own life;
never the same for two days in succession, and yet
always the same. On sunny afternoons, great, white
clouds hung over it and the blue of the sky lay mirrored
in the long, narrow strips of water far out. Then
would come the disturbing breezes, growing into winds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
that moved the trees and reed banks, then into the hurricane
that transformed it all, till it vibrated like a living
and suffering being, its green acres of sedge whipped
to a surface like shot silk, its channels churned to a
muddy red, the moving sky glaring with storm, and the
stunted hemlocks, huddling frantically together along its
edges. This old swamp, hated and loved, defeated, but
eternal, was relic of all that Mauney regretted in those
sad hours that came upon him during the summer
months.</p>

<p>But these remembrances were being pushed back
farther and farther out of sense, while the vital events
of life occupied him more and more. Coming into the
house, tired, but satisfied, after the day’s work in the
hayfield, he would sit quietly on the kitchen verandah,
watching the sun sink beyond the corner of the big,
dark barn. The sound of crickets filled the air with
a metallic vibration. His contentment was as deep as
the gulf of crimson sky above him, and his happiness
as much a-quiver as the air. As he sat here, lulled into
grateful meditation, perhaps Evelyn would interrupt
him.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet a dollar, Maun, you’re in love!” she would
venture.</p>

<p>And he would wonder if it was possible that any
love was ever quite as wonderful as his for Freda.
Never since human life began had any woman been as
dear as she was to him. She was so real. There was
not an atom of dissimulation about her. Freda—who
had flashed upon him like a blinding light, who had believed
in him—had become constant in his thoughts.
Freda was the great reality. Nothing could daunt him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
nothing could make him one little bit unhappy, so long
as he knew that ultimately he would possess her.</p>

<p>But he purposely refrained from seeing her much.
The few calls that he made at her home were in response
to her invitations, and he fancied that she understood
well enough the reasons for his restraint.</p>

<p>The hot harvest season passed very tardily. The
August sun grew more intense as the long, sultry days
drew out. There was never even a cloudy day to remove
the accumulating tension of the heat. The grey,
baked earth cracked into deep fissures. The wells
dried up, and even the waters of the marsh sank, day
by day, until at the end of the month they were entirely
gone. There was no greenness anywhere; the rushes
and sedges were burnt into amber shades, with yellow
fuzz that blended dully with the parched meadows.
And the creatures of the swamp were either silent or
departed. Mauney missed them.</p>

<p>The farmers began to talk ruin. William Henry
McBratney, passing the lane on a visit from Beulah,
pulled up his horse to discuss the weather with Mauney.
His evil face, the more evil because of its senile wasting,
was painfully worried, and his mad, dim eyes
sparkled in accord with his feelings.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, Maun,” he said, striking his knee with his
sprawling, bony palm, “I’ve seed a good many dry spells,
but nothing like this. It’s nigh onto fifty years since
me and my first missus settled here. But, sir, I tell you
what! This here harvest has been the driest ever.”</p>

<p>“But I think we’ll get rain, don’t you?” asked
Mauney.</p>

<p>“No, sir, I don’t,” affirmed the old man, with an expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
of settled gloom. “Every mornin’ I’ve been a-looking
for a cloud or two, but that sky, sir, I tell yuh,
couldn’t hold a cloud. It’s too damned hot fer to hold
a single cloud! An’, if we don’t get rain the cattle’s
goin’ to die.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear sir,” persisted Mauney, “rain is bound
to come. Did you ever see it fail?”</p>

<p>“All I’m sayin’ is, that since I come here—me an’ the
missus—that there marsh hain’t never onct dried up
that way. Yer father, Seth, never seed it like that,
I tell yuh. No, sir. An’ if it’s me ye’r askin’ I’d deny
that there’ll be any rain. Leastways, I’d hev to see it
to believe it!”</p>

<p>Such logic was more depressing than convincing.</p>

<h3 id="IV_CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="smcap">The First Day.</span></h3>

<p>On the first of September, when Mauney came to
Lockwood to find a boarding-place and to buy
a few articles of clothing before the school term began,
he found everybody in ill humor. Along Queen Street
West, in the shop district, men were sweltering, with
handkerchiefs tucked about their collars, carrying their
coats and fanning themselves with their hats. In a
shoe store the air was humid and suffocating, and the
patience of the young clerk seemed dangerously exhausted.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why you don’t like those oxfords,” he
said, gruffly, as he unlaced the third shoe he had tried
to sell his customer.</p>

<p>“And we’re not going into the reasons for our dislike,”
Mauney replied. “I don’t like them, and that’s
all there is to it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” sighed the clerk, “we’ve got better shoes in
the store; but you’d have to pay twelve-fifty.”</p>

<p>“Have you any objection to me paying twelve-fifty?”</p>

<p>The shoes were fitted.</p>

<p>“You won’t make any mistake if you get those, sir,”
affirmed the salesman, more affably. “I just sold a
pair of those very shoes to Ted Courtney, not more
than an hour ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>“And who the devil is Ted Courtney?” asked Mauney.</p>

<p>The clerk surveyed his customer blankly for a moment.
“If you don’t know who the Courtneys are,” he
mumbled, at length, “you don’t know much about Lockwood.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to confess that I don’t,” admitted Mauney,
with a chuckle to himself, “but these shoes suit me all
right.”</p>

<p>He next entered a haberdashery shop and asked for
shirts. The clerk was a smartly-dressed man of middle
age.</p>

<p>“You don’t care for those,” he commented, as
Mauney finished surveying some that were on display.
“Well, we haven’t much choice left in the cheaper
lines, but I can show you some in a very excellent
material. This particular shirt,” he continued, as he
selected an example, “is being worn by the best dressers
this season. We have had difficulty keeping stocked
in it. I may say that I sold a half-dozen of this line
to Mr. Ted Courtney, only yesterday.”</p>

<p>Mauney’s hand fell limply on the counter as he began
to laugh for no reason apparent to the serious-faced
salesman.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d tell me who Ted Courtney is. I haven’t
been able to decide as yet whether he is the Beau Nash
of Lockwood or a cousin of the Prince of Wales.”</p>

<p>“You’re a stranger in town? Indeed. The Courtneys,
of course, are among our wealthiest residents—awfully
nice people, with whom it is always a pleasure
to deal.”</p>

<p>“In that case,” said Mauney, with an amused expression,
“I suppose I had better fall in line.”</p>

<p>Next he proceeded to a tobacconist’s to buy a newspaper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
and cigarettes. While he was talking to the clerk
he realized that he was being gently, but effectively,
elbowed sidewise by a stranger, who, in his impatience
to capture a newspaper from a pile nearby, reached
directly in front of Mauney’s face. In drawing out
his copy of the journal he not only upset the pile, but
knocked the silver out of Mauney’s hand. Turning in
expectation of adjusting what was evidently an unavoidable
situation, Mauney was surprised to behold the
young man walking quickly away through the door and
entering a sumptuous motor-car at the curb. He watched
him drive away, then turned to the clerk.</p>

<p>“Did you notice who that fellow was?” he asked.</p>

<p>“You bet I did,” the other snarled, as he brought
order once more to the untidy counter, “and I’ve got
his number, too. That bird is getting just a wee bit
too fresh. Just because his old man happened to make
a few dishonest millions out West, he’s got the idea
that the rest of us bums just live to wait on him. But
I’ll tell you one thing,” he added with a curse, “the
next time he tries any rough-house he’s going to get
a heavy lid.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t blame you much,” said Mauney, picking
up his change. “Who is he?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know him? Why that’s Mister Edward
Courtney. Lives in that house down Queen East that
looks like a bloody prison. Got about twenty motor-cars,
but don’t know when he’s well off. Just let him
try that trick again and, so help me Kate, I don’t care
if it takes me to the police court, he’s goin’ to get a
rocker right on that damned dimple!”</p>

<p>That evening, when talking to Freda, Mauney related<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
the incident and was surprised when she defended
Courtney.</p>

<p>“I haven’t any use for the family taken collectively,”
she admitted, “but you’d have to know Ted to understand
that incident. He’s really not such a bad lot—a
most terrible enthusiast over trifles and frightfully
absent-minded at times. Probably when he bunted into
you he was in a hurry to get to the ball game and didn’t
realize what he was doing. I’ve known Ted just about
all my life, and I’d put it down to pure thoughtlessness
and animal pep. Of course, he’s spoiled and needs a
lesson, I know that!”</p>

<p>“You’ll get accustomed to Lockwood ways, perhaps,”
she said a little later, as she took Mauney for a spin
up the river road, out of town. “And perhaps you
won’t. I hate to discourage you, but I’m a little afraid
you never will tune up to Lockwood. I never have,
and we’re something alike, are we not?”</p>

<p>As they sped along the winding tarvia road, under
arching elms, past clusters of willows in the hollows,
and groves of pine, with numerous summer residences
facing the river, Freda kept nodding to acquaintances
in other cars.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that Courtney’s roadster?” asked Mauney, turning
to see it disappear behind them.</p>

<p>“Yes, and Ted saw me,” laughed Freda, “and, what’s
more exciting, he saw you. I’ll bet anything he’ll turn
around and overtake us before we’ve gone much
farther. I’ll tell you what, Mauney! We’ll stop at the
Country Club. I’m not a member any more, but a lot
of the real Lockwood swells hang out there. Of course,
I just want to show you off. Mrs. Beecher will see
you and then to-morrow at some tea or other she’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
let out the big item of the season. I can just hear her
as she makes her announcement: ‘What do you suppose!
Freda MacDowell breezed into the club last
night with a Mr. Bard, who, I understand, is the new
member of the collegiate staff. Hum, hum, now what
do you think of that?’”</p>

<p>“And what will they think of it, Freda?” asked
Mauney seriously.</p>

<p>“They can’t think. They haven’t got the equipment.
It’s just the news they’re after, nothing more. They
can’t think anything, anyway. But I want them to know
that you were riding in my car. Of course,” chuckled
Freda, “if you were a married man, then they’d be
happier. They’d have a scandal, then.”</p>

<p>“Is there much scandal in Lockwood?” Mauney
asked, carelessly.</p>

<p>“Scandal!” she exclaimed. “Why, these people live
on it. I just wish I could smuggle you into a real <i lang="la">bona
fide</i> afternoon tea. It’s a very tame tea that doesn’t
succeed in executing at least one hitherto unblemished
reputation. It’s love affairs they prefer, of course. But—am
I boring you?”</p>

<p>“On the contrary I’m quite interested, Freda. Most
towns are the same.”</p>

<p>“But Lockwood has developed it to something like a
fine art,” she replied, with the certainty of tone of an
expert who has studied the matter in hand. Then she
proceeded to give a characteristically accurate summary
of the entire subject.</p>

<p>“There were afternoon teas in Lockwood before there
were churches, and even to-day they are better attended.
Church, with these people, is an occasional business,
but teas are a constant necessity. Some of these fat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
society dames have reached the sublime stage of existence
where their enfeebled brains can deal with only
the simplest data. They can’t read books that require
any thought. They don’t have to read, so for that very
reason they don’t read. But they do have to go to
afternoon teas, because it’s there they find the exact
food they’re in need of. I don’t mean cookies and
cakes, either, because most of them have been requested
by their M.D.’s to cut down on carbo-hydrates. What
they need, Mauney, is scandal. If the scandal deals with
a love affair, why then it’s an A1 scandal. Anything
racy and illicit holds them like nothing else. Now, just
why these bloated excuses for womanhood—and many
of them have had turbulent enough youths themselves—should
get to the stage where only vicarious experiences
can stir their vanishing passions, is a question
that revolts me. I leave that for the morbid psychologists
to settle.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you something, Mauney,” she went on, as
she looked before her along the road. “These afternoon
teas are no joke with me. I hate them as I hate
anything that’s noisy and empty. They had a lot to do
with my leaving home.”</p>

<p>“But did you ever think, Freda,” asked Mauney,
“that gossip unconsciously cleanses society? People,
fearing scandal, are more likely to be careful how they
act.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” she replied. “There’s something in that
argument, too. If these old gossipers in Lockwood
were conscientiously trying to reform society by means
of publicity campaigns I’d give them credit. In the
first place, however, they don’t give a continental about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
morals, public or private, and in the second place,
they’re very corruptible.”</p>

<p>“Corruptible?”</p>

<p>“Yes; they grant exemptions. There are people in
Lockwood who can get away with murder just because
they’ve got money. There are people who are never
discussed because the scandal-mongers fear to lose their
favor. No; I put no stock in that cleansing business
at all. I’ve told you exactly what I think of the whole
bunch.”</p>

<p>“But why take them so seriously, Freda?” asked
Mauney. “It’s almost an adage that women will gossip
just as men will smoke.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s because of the way I’m constituted,”
she replied. “We had a wash-woman who used to say
to me, ‘Freda, everything all depends on just how it is
with you.’ And I’ll tell you just how it is with me,
Mauney. I’ve got a serious streak somewhere in my
system.”</p>

<p>“I think you’re the most serious girl I know,” interrupted
Mauney.</p>

<p>“Thanks. I admire your insight, young man. I
really do want to thank you for just that, Mauney. But
I was going to tell you that I went through hell, almost
literally, six years ago, just before I went to college.
The real hard-boiled fact of the case was that I lost
my respect for my own mother, and the main reason I
lost it was because, apparently, she could live and thrive
and be entirely satisfied on the mental diet of afternoon-tea
scandals. So, although, as you say, gossiping may
be considered as part of the day’s work, it sometimes
has unforeseen results. And once or twice I’ve seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
people rendered extremely unhappy, by scandals they
didn’t deserve. The ladies aren’t a bit accurate.”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Mauney, “you ought to write a book
on scandal-mongery as well as one on a university.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I was going to tell you the hidden irony
of this scandal-mongery in Lockwood. It will show
you just how insincere they are. The persons scandalized
become popular, provided their misdeeds are not
merely stupid. They become actually heroes. They
are admired secretly all the time. They gain an importance
never before enjoyed. But they don’t know
this, and they suffer needlessly under the lash of
women’s tongues. I tell you, Mauney, these women will
excuse a person for anything. All they ask is the vicarious
fun of it for themselves. I knew a merchant in
town who never had much of a business until after it
was reported that he had for years been running
another home up in Merlton. Apparently they admired,
not only his personal cleverness, but his business ability
to be able to afford it. He became popular at once
and has had a good trade ever since.”</p>

<p>Freda was now turning down a side road to the
river, where on the level bank stood the Country Club
House, a long, low bungalow finished in shingles of British
Columbia cedar. On the wide verandahs which
surrounded it many young and middle-aged people were
sitting at tables, drinking or standing in groups engaged
in conversation.</p>

<p>They left the car at the end of a long line on the
side of the road and walked towards the verandah. They
could hear the tones of the piano within the pavilion,
and as they came nearer could see the moving figures
of people dancing. As Freda guided Mauney about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
the verandah, nodding to several of the guests, he
noticed that the constant buzz of conversation was concerned
chiefly with golf. Mauney was introduced to
some of the members, and as he talked with them found
himself slightly ill at ease, because he had never learned
to play golf. After a few minutes he began to be conscious
of many curious eyes turned in his direction,
some of them friendly enough, others merely curious,
and a few intensely critical. The conversation was
growing less. He felt awkward until he suddenly realized
that all these people had been waiting for something,
when at last a roadster, which had now become
familiar to Mauney, glided quickly up to the verandah,
uncomfortably filled with men. As they alighted, carrying
musical instruments, it became clear that Courtney
had motored to town after an orchestra. An impromptu
dance immediately followed.</p>

<p>It had no sooner begun than Courtney, finding Freda
at a table with Mauney, came up to speak to her. Gracefully
tall, wearing flannels, bare-headed and completely
at ease, he appeared to be not older than twenty-five.
His black hair was scrupulously barbered and glossy.
His flashing, black eyes seemed to know the world, and
there was an air of mild superiority, not only in his
confident carriage, but in the exclusive smile of black
moustachios, red lips, and very white, perfect teeth,
with which he greeted Freda.</p>

<p>“Hello, Fly-away,” he said in a deep, musical voice.
“I swear you were doing fifty when I passed you.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Courtney,” said Freda, turning towards
Mauney, who had risen, “meet Mr. Bard, my friend.”</p>

<p>“How do you do?” said Courtney, with a stiff nod;
then devoted himself quickly to Freda once more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>“Awful night for a dance,” he admitted. “But everybody
wanted it, so I blew down for Pinkerton’s Harmony
Hounds. Lockwood must be agreeing with you,
Freda. I never saw you look more captivating.”</p>

<p>“Thanks for those few kind words, Ted,” she replied
dryly, although she blushed and wished in a queer flash
that Mauney could occasionally say such flattering
things.</p>

<p>“Are you dancing?” Courtney inquired.</p>

<p>“Really, Ted, it’s too warm, thank you; and Mr.
Bard and I will be leaving soon, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” he said, with a quick side-glance in
Mauney’s direction. Then he turned towards him.
“Staying in town long, Mr. Bard, may I ask?”</p>

<p>“Quite a little while,” said Mauney. “I’m billed to
appear every morning at nine—at the collegiate, in the
role of plain teacher.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Courtney with evident surprise.
“Teacher! Oh, indeed! I don’t envy you the job of
trying to pound knowledge into some of the local skulls,
but I hope you like the town.”</p>

<p>“So far I’ve found it unusually interesting,” replied
Mauney, with a twinkle of mischievous light in his
eyes. “I think the word ‘variegated’ would describe my
first impressions—some skulls much thicker than others,
as you can readily imagine.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, yes, of course,” said Courtney, a trifle puzzled
at Mauney’s apparent innuendo. “I’m damned if
I quite grasp what you mean, though.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, it’s like this,” smiled Mauney, with
sudden decision to soften his own manner to the meaningless
vapidity of Courtney’s, “I’ve really been here
only one day as yet and, no matter how shrewd an observer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
I was, one could hardly expect me to know the
place, could one?”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” readily admitted Courtney, with a
glance toward Freda, who was quite preoccupied.
“Well, Freda,” he said, turning to leave, “I trust you
will be more careful about speeding in future. I hear
Pinkerton’s outfit getting into their stride; so, cheerio!”
With a little wave of his hand he left, without again
looking at Mauney.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="IV_CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="smcap">An Old Friend.</span></h3>

<p>Mauney found a boarding-house on Church Street,
directly opposite the collegiate institute, a plain
unit, in a plain brick terrace set close to the sidewalk.
He engaged the down-stairs front room, which looked
directly upon the thoroughfare by a wide window. He
liked the room chiefly because of this window, for it
afforded a generous view of the street and promised
an excellent point of vantage. The landlady was a
gigantic Irish woman whose husband worked in a
foundry. It seemed to Mauney that their occupations
ought to have been interchanged, for the husband was
a puny, sickly fellow, thoroughly subdued by his wife’s
temper. He had a way of moving quietly and guiltily
through the house, as if expecting her to pounce on
his back at any moment.</p>

<p>The first morning of Mauney’s occupancy, Mrs. Hudson
came into his room, gowned in her collarless, blue,
print dress, broom in hand. As school would not open
for a day or two, Mauney was engaged in arranging
his books.</p>

<p>“Oh! and it’s a scholar ye are, is it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Teacher, Mrs. Hudson,” he explained.</p>

<p>“Indade, an’ sure I t’ought, all the time, ye were a
commarcial trovler,” she said, surveying the volumes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
he was taking from his trunk. “I knew ye were a
sangle mon. But I t’ought ye were a commarcial trovler.
An’ which schule, might I be asking, are ye goin’
to be teaching at?”</p>

<p>“That one,” he said, pointing through the window at
the grey stone mass across the street.</p>

<p>“Poor mon,” she sighed, as books still continued to
come forth from the trunk. “It must keep ye busy.
I’m glad ye’re a quiet mon.”</p>

<p>“Do I look quiet?” laughed Mauney.</p>

<p>“Ay, ye do thot, an’ imogine me thinkin’ ye were a
commarcial trovler, now. Well, the saints rest ye, when
are ye ging to rade all thim books?”</p>

<p>“In the evenings, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Imogine, now. Poor mon! Have ye no friends in
town?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, a few.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good thing,” she said, starting towards the
hall, “and ye’ll not be throubled with noise, onyway.
’Tis a very, very quiet house. An’ I’m afther thinking
ye’ll need plenty o’ quietness for to read so mony
books. Poor mon, an’ me thinkin’ ye were a commarcial
trovler. Imagine, now!”</p>

<p>After she had gone, Mauney stood, idly watching an
old man in a faded navy-blue suit, as he made his way
slowly up the street. The senile curve of his figure
was accentuated by a long, white beard, that flopped
in front of his body as he jogged along. With each
determined, but feeble, step he struck the pavement a
sharp rap with his thick, metal-tipped cane. At regular
intervals of about ten paces he invariably paused and
turned slowly about to gaze backward, as though he
were proudly calculating the extent of his efforts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>Mauney hardly saw the old fellow. His thoughts
were running busily along with plans for his work
soon to begin. Then he suddenly thought of Freda
and his bosom burned, while the day seemed to expand
and brighten. He had dreamed of her in the
night, and she came upon his consciousness now with
that unspeakable dearness, which dreams, though half-forgotten,
lend to our waking thoughts. Her dark eyes
were before him like infinite comfort; the sound of her
voice formed a music in his mind. He wanted nothing
more than Freda. He prayed that heaven would
refuse him all other gifts, but her. When he opened
his eyes slowly, there was the old man just in the act
of turning to gaze back along the sultry street.</p>

<p>From the other edge of the window he espied the
quicker figure of Henry Dover, the collegiate principal,
on his way to his office. Although dressed in a
grey, flannel suit, and a straw hat, his appearance was
not lightsome. Of medium height, he walked with a
pensive inclination of his head, but with an energetic
and measured stride, while his arms, curved at the
elbows, swung rhythmically beside him. Here was a
careful, strong, man, thoroughly accustomed to the
harness of office. Henry Dover, dressed in a Prussian
general’s uniform, and following in the cortege of a
field-marshal’s funeral, would perform the part with
great credit.</p>

<p>Later in the morning, as Mauney sat idly by the
window, he was conscious that the room was all at once
illuminated by reflected sunlight. He looked up quickly
at the figure who was passing and saw, under the
shadow of her hat, and at a very near view, the face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
of Jean Byrne. With an instinctive turn of her head
she at once recognized him, hesitated and then stopped.</p>

<p>“Mauney Bard! Where did you come from?”</p>

<p>“Wait till I get my hat,” replied Mauney.</p>

<p>“Well, Mrs. Poynton,” he said as he joined her on the
street and shook hands with her. “It’s a great pleasure
to see such an old friend, again.”</p>

<p>“The same to you,” she said, as they walked along,
and favored him with the close scrutiny permitted to
old friends on meeting. “You’ve changed some way or
other, Mauney, but I’d know you anywhere. Your hair
has lost its brilliance, and you look like a man of affairs.
After reading your book I didn’t know what
you’d be like. I heard a few days ago that you were
going to teach here; so you see you’ve taken my advice
after all.”</p>

<p>Her voice and manner were the same, although
Mauney fancied she was more animated, an impression
possibly due to her extravagant, but tasteful, costume.</p>

<p>“I’ve nearly lost track of you,” he admitted. “I’d
like to talk over old times. Are you on your way down
town?”</p>

<p>“Just to the post office. Will you come along?”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he nodded. “Where do you live, may
I ask?”</p>

<p>“Just a little way up Church Street, the second house
past the Baptist Church. We used to live on Queen
Street East, but when Charles went out West this spring—by
the way, did you know that the doctor had left
Lockwood?”</p>

<p>“No, I hadn’t heard that.”</p>

<p>“He found the town so conservative and stodgy that
he thought he’d prefer things out there, and I felt that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
until he got settled I’d better stay here with mother.
She’s getting old, you know, and is practically an invalid
with rheumatism.”</p>

<p>As they were coming out of the post office, Mauney
noticed one of the middle-aged women whom he had
met the previous evening at the club, sitting in a motor
car at the curb. She bowed affably, then glanced
quickly at Mrs. Poynton.</p>

<p>“Do you know Mrs. Squires?” Jean asked as they
walked along.</p>

<p>“Yes, met her only last night.”</p>

<p>Before leaving Jean at her home he accepted her
invitation to come up for dinner that evening. Her
mother was then discovered to be a woman prematurely
aged by a morose and taciturn disposition, which seemed
to account for her daughter’s surprising animation.
Jean made good to Mauney what her mother’s manner
lacked in friendliness. And, indeed, the home was all
in distinct contrast with the impression of affluence
which Jean’s street appearance had so unquestionably
made.</p>

<p>Dinner finished, Mrs. Byrne at once settled herself
in a chair by a western window, and, adjusting a second
pair of glasses, reached a Bible from the window-sill.
Mauney thought this might herald a session of family
worship, and was relieved when his hostess led him to
the parlor. With a Bohemian grace that was foreign
to his conception of his former country-school teacher,
Jean opened for him a silver box of cigarettes, and
selecting one for herself pressed it neatly into a pearl
holder.</p>

<p>“Times have changed, since Lantern Marsh days,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
she said, smiling gently, “and I hope you have learned
by this time to excuse women for their little follies.”</p>

<p>“I am free and easy,” laughed Mauney. “I’ve been
living for the last few years in a house where cigarette-smoke
was the prevailing perfume.”</p>

<p>“And about five years on Queen Street East,” Jean
said, “have made these things almost essential to me. I
started smoking at bridges in self-defence, and now my
meals don’t digest without them. Charles always hated
me to smoke. But I presume he realized the environment
was to blame.”</p>

<p>For perhaps an hour they talked of Beulah and its
inhabitants, of deaths and marriages, of careers which
had justified their early promise, and of others which
had not. Mauney briefly outlined his college experiences,
but noticed that she said almost nothing about
her own married life. All girlishness had departed
from her face, and gone, too, was a certain carelessness
of appearance which had formerly been quite refreshing.
She was now, as nearly as he could judge, possessed
of a dormant bitterness, never expressed, but as
ugly as she was attractive. He found himself not a little
curious to learn her philosophy, but even now he
felt the same unexplainable distaste in her presence as
he had felt during a certain evening drive, seven years
ago. To be sure Jean had lost the directness which had
then displeased him. She had become more subtle,
more complex. But in this quiet parlor a mental hand
was reaching towards him with the same emotional
intent.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said at length, “you’re a sly fox. You’ve
told me all about your life just as if there hadn’t been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
a single woman in it. Now, please confess, as I am
desperately curious.”</p>

<p>For some reason Mauney preserved a guarded attitude.
The last thing he could have discussed, or even
mentioned, was his love for Freda MacDowell.</p>

<p>“I am not much of a ladies’ man,” he smiled. “I’ve
been told that I was a woman-hater. I guess my early
upbringing was against me that way.”</p>

<p>He soon left the house, feeling that old friendships did
not necessarily improve with years, and that he himself,
free and easy as he might be, was not attracted by a
home where Bible-reading and cigarette-smoking were
indulged by different members at the same time. It
was not artistic. As for Jean, she was not an admirable
person, nor even winning. He felt that he did
not care if they should never meet again.</p>

<h3 id="IV_CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="smcap">Seen at the Market.</span></h3>

<p>During the first week of September Freda saw
nothing of Mauney. Each day she kept expecting
that he would either call or telephone. She tried
to explain his delinquency by the excuse of work; but
no excuse could justify it, especially when she might
be returning to Merlton at the end of the month. Her
impatience increased daily. She was remaining quietly
at home, assisting in the house work, and systematically
declining invitations. She was prompted on Saturday
morning to telephone him and find out what was the
matter. On second thought she decided not to make
any overtures whatever. She had planned going to the
market.</p>

<p>That was one thing about Lockwood that Freda
loved. Saturday morning, she insisted on going to
market for her mother. Long before sunrise the quietness
of Queen Street was disturbed by the creaking
wheels of farmers’ wagons coming into town, and by
eight o’clock River Street Square presented a varied assembly
of picturesque conveyances, each backed accurately
to the cement walk that surrounded the enclosure.
In the centre of the square stood a fountain,
well covered by a generous canopy of faded maroon
canvas, under which the farmers’ horses were allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
to stand while their owners presided, for three busy
hours, beside their wagon-loads of produce.</p>

<p>It was a turbulent market, invaded with throngs of
bargain-seeking citizens, and defended by shrewd, rustic
salesmen, who withheld all bargains until the last possible
moment. On certain days—no one knew why—a
spirit of great conservatism reigned, when the farmers
ill-temperedly refused to lower prices, and the customers
with equal stubbornness, refused to buy. At other
times a happier contact prevailed, and citizens captured
what seemed stupendous bargains until, on walking
further along the rows of wagons, they discovered, too
late, the advantages of caution.</p>

<p>On this Saturday, early in September, Freda set out
for River Street Square to indulge her great Lockwood
affection. A woman could wear any kind of clothes at
market, and Freda accordingly donned a yellow silk
sweater, and set forth bareheaded. Carrying a large
market basket, she walked leisurely along Queen Street,
enjoying the spectacle of other folk arriving, similarly
equipped.</p>

<p>On reaching the edge of the square, she almost collided
with one, Fenton Bramley, a tall, ill-groomed, but
strong-featured man of possibly sixty. Although
slightly stooped, his carriage suggested the British army
as unerringly as his polite manner betrayed the fundamental
gentleman that he was. Bramley’s lines had
fallen in barren places, but he was in direct descent
from English nobility and could have been a knight
even now, if he had possessed the necessary funds to
clarify his title. Every one liked and tolerated “Fen.”
He was a Lockwood fixture. In conversation he maintained
the off-handed ease and abruptness of introduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
characteristic of his thorough self-possession. He
spoke to every one and every one spoke to him.</p>

<p>“Freda,” he commenced in a quiet, conversational
tone, as if he had been talking with her continually
for the past hour, “I see where that cove that murdered
the bank teller’s got his sentence. Did ye see
that?”</p>

<p>“Why, no, Fen,” she laughed; “I’m afraid I missed
the item.”</p>

<p>“It was an item all right,” he continued. “And I
had a letter yesterday from Frank Booth. He’s away
up in the Yukon an’ says things are boomin’.”</p>

<p>“Frank Booth,” repeated Freda, trying to place the
name.</p>

<p>“Maybe you don’t remember him,” admitted Bramley,
scowling down attentively into her face. “You’re lookin’
the picture of health, Freda. And I’m not so bad
myself. It’s a big market to-day. Some time when
you’re passing the house, slip in tu see my furnitoor.
Yer feyther was lookin’ it over and said he liked it.
Did ye see where they arrested the head of the drug
ring in Merlton?”</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“I had a letter last week from Mac Tupper,” continued
Bramley in his discursive way. “He’s down in
New York, an’ says since prohibition came in they—”</p>

<p>“Tupper?” interrupted Freda.</p>

<p>“Maybe he was before your time. A great man wi’
the billiard cue was Mac! How’s yer feyther?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s fine.”</p>

<p>“An’ yer mother?”</p>

<p>“She’s well too.”</p>

<p>“And yerself?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dandy.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye.” Bramley plucked off his cap, bowed
and walked quickly away.</p>

<p>“How, much are your eggs?” Freda asked a farmer.</p>

<p>“The cheapest they’ll be this here autumn, lady,” he
answered indifferently, with scarcely a look at his intending
customer.</p>

<p>“But that gives me very little idea of the price,” she
replied.</p>

<p>“Strictly fresh, them eggs is, too,” he said. “Picked
right out o’ the hay last night. It’s one thing to get
fresh eggs, but it’s a different thing to get strictly
fresh!”</p>

<p>He picked up one of the eggs and balanced it on the
points of his fingers.</p>

<p>“Look at that!” he invited. “Nice, clean, white egg.
D’ye notice the shape of that egg?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then notice them in the basket,” he said, pointing
to the wagon. “They’s all the same shape. You can
depend on ’em lady.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I put it this way,” smiled Freda. “What
are they worth a dozen?”</p>

<p>“I’m not saying what they’re <em>worth</em>, lady, but—”</p>

<p>At this juncture the dialogue was interrupted by a
short, florid-faced woman, with big, wide, blue eyes,
who recognized Freda and came waddling toward her.</p>

<p>“Well, well, Freda,” she began, putting down her
basket. “I don’t know when I’ve seen <em>you</em>. I always
<em>like</em> to see you. It always makes me think of poor
Jennie. Poor Jennie always liked you, poor child!
Even when she could hardly sit up she’d always talk
about you. Poor Jennie! She always sat next to you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
in school, didn’t she? She liked you because you said
she was so pretty; and she <em>was</em> a pretty child, too. Just
think of her and you sitting there together. Ain’t it
strange how as it’s always the beautiful are taken?”</p>

<p>Freeing herself as soon as possible from the garrulous
mother of the departed Jennie, Freda began to
market in earnest. A wagon-load of meat attracted her
attention first. When the farmer had finished with a
group of customers, she pointed to some choice-looking
mutton.</p>

<p>“How much is the lamb?” she enquired.</p>

<p>“Gawd knows ’tis little enough,” he replied in a rasping,
sorrowful tone, while he made gestures of innocence
“Gawd knows I’m not tryin’ to flace dacent
people like yourself. Gawd bless ye. And when ye see
the rubbitch as yon jackeen does be haulin’ t’ town”—he
nodded towards his nearest opposition—“and see the
rediculeus price he does be afther askin’ fer it, Gawd
knows, woman, ’tis little enough that I shud ask ony
twinty-foive cints.”</p>

<p>“Still,” objected Freda, “it seems a little high, doesn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“High!” he exclaimed. “Wirra, woman, ye misjidge
me! Gawd knows ye’d pay nigh double the price at
the butcher’s shop. An’ I’m afther thinkin’ that it’s dodderin’
little that a pretty, young lady ass yerself does be
knowin’ o’ the price o’ butcher’s mate, so it is. Gawd
bless ye!”</p>

<p>“Gawd know’s that’s done it,” laughed Freda, placing
her order. “I’d buy it now even if I didn’t want
it.”</p>

<p>While the farmer was carefully weighing the meat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
Freda was surprised by the sudden appearance of Edward
Courtney, walking through the crowd toward her.</p>

<p>“Girl,” he said, in his deep voice, “how much more
do you intend to buy?”</p>

<p>“Not much, Ted,” she replied. “Why?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. I was waiting to spin you home and maybe
play you a game of cribbage before lunch. Like it?”</p>

<p>“Um-hum,” she nodded.</p>

<p>“But don’t hurry,” he said. “I’m idle to-day as usual,
and totally at your service.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you an obliging person! Do you want to
take my basket?”</p>

<p>“Pardon, how stupid of me!”</p>

<p>Marketing eventually finished, although not nearly so
well finished as might have been, they wound their circuitous
way to Queen Street, and, depositing the basket
in the back of Courtney’s car, climbed quickly in and
motored home.</p>

<p>Courtney had a way of making himself swiftly at
home with people he wished to befriend. He carried
Freda’s purchases boldly into her house, through the
dining room and into the kitchen, where Mrs. MacDowell
was peeling potatoes.</p>

<p>“I rescued your daughter just as she was finishing,”
he announced. He was pressing her wet hand, obdurate
to her excuses, and bowing as punctiliously as at a
drawing-room reception. “I hope you’re quite well,
Mrs. MacDowell. Freda and I are going to have a
game of cribbage before lunch.”</p>

<p>On the verandah they arranged chairs by the small
table and began playing.</p>

<p>“The old town does bear down pretty heavily, Freda—what?”
he enquired as he dealt the cards. “The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
mater is slipping down to New York and Phily for a
short duty call, and I’m wondering what wild schemes
I can perpetrate during her regretted absence. I had
thought of a foursome up the river in the big boat to-morrow
night, but unfortunately the skipper has been
graciously granted a week’s shore-leave. Damn! The
mater takes this generous tack merely as a curb on my
propensities.”</p>

<p>“Hard luck, Edward.”</p>

<p>“But mark my vow, Freda—some time before I’m
eighty, I’m going to stage a buster aboard the gentle
<i>Cinderella</i>. However, I’ve got the launch in shape and
all I need now is a personnel for this proposed voyage.
What say?”</p>

<p>“Ted, I simply couldn’t go.”</p>

<p>He smiled while his eyes wandered over her fingers.</p>

<p>“I don’t notice either a diamond or a frat-pin,” he
replied, teasingly.</p>

<p>“No; but, nevertheless, Ted, I’m practically engaged.”</p>

<p>“What, ho!” he exclaimed, in a low tone of surprise.
“Freda, girl, are you genuine?”</p>

<p>“I really mean it, Ted.”</p>

<p>“Dear heavens!” he mused. “Incidentally, though,
my congratulations! Is it a secret?”</p>

<p>“Yes, just at present.”</p>

<p>“Then, I’ll regard it so. But to think of the partner
of my youthful adventures being no longer available.
Well,” he added in a voice unusually serious for him,
“Somebody’s lucky.”</p>

<p>“Why! You know you don’t care,” she rejoined offhandedly.</p>

<p>Courtney’s face was sufficiently mask-like to hide
whatever feelings he experienced, and accustomed
enough to all contingencies to smile with its usual ease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tell me, then,” he presently inquired, “aren’t you
going to come dancing with me any more?”</p>

<p>“Possibly.”</p>

<p>“There’s going to be a <i lang="fr">bon</i> affair at the Country Club
in the shape of an informal free-for-all for clubbers
and guests. It’s on Wednesday. You’d better come.”</p>

<p>“Well, Ted,” she sighed, after a moment’s hesitation,
“I’m on. What time?”</p>

<p>“Expect me at nine—and thanks awfully.”</p>

<p>The cribbage game was soon finished and Courtney,
with a final <i lang="fr">bon mot</i>, was striding towards his car, while
Freda in an idle mood was thinking that, for all his
shallow opulence and apparent emptiness, he possessed
a social grace that was admittedly worth while.</p>

<h3 id="IV_CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="smcap">The Reliable Man.</span></h3>

<p>Next day, Freda was agreeably surprised to be
called on the telephone, about ten in the morning.</p>

<p>“Are you going to church?” asked Mauney.</p>

<p>“No, are you?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I’m too fed up, Freda, to bother. It’s going to be a
warm day and I think we ought to get out in the country,
up the river some place. I’ve got a lot to talk about.”</p>

<p>They motored to Shadow Bay, a dozen miles west
of Lockwood, and had dinner together at the Chalet,
a summer place, which, owing to the auspicious weather,
was still open.</p>

<p>“I’m beginning to understand Lockwood better,”
Mauney said, as they sat on a shaded cliff after dinner.
“I don’t remember ever having put in a more disagreeable
week in my life.”</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?” she enquired, with no suggestion
in her voice that her own past week had been the most
unpleasant she could recall.</p>

<p>“Just everything,” he said. “I’m foolish to mind it
at all. But the staff of the collegiate are the hardest
people to get acquainted with. They’re all capable,
unusually so, but terribly stand-offish.”</p>

<p>“That, my dear boy, is the key-note of Lockwood,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
she interrupted. “They’ve just naturally acquired that
manner.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt it,” he nodded. “But I wish they’d
get over it. They seem to think I’m a high-brow, or
something just as bad. Inadvertently I heard a couple
of the men discussing my book, knocking it to beat
the deuce.”</p>

<p>“And do you actually care, Mauney Bard?” she asked
in a surprised tone.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” he replied. “I’ve always been damnably
lonesome for pals, for good fellows, who, like Max
Lee, could see the motive behind the act. Freda, you
know the motive behind my book. You know it was
merely a wish of mine to warm up the subject of history
a little bit. Well, these chaps agreed that it was
mere nonsense.”</p>

<p>“That,” sneered Freda, “was mere jealousy. They
haven’t tried to write a book. If they had they’d be
more lenient. But really,” she added, looking Mauney
seriously in the eye, “I think you must be tired, for I
never saw you so down in the mouth, before.”</p>

<p>She wanted to pillow his head in her lap, and tell
him that his book was the best one ever written. She
longed to comfort him and change his loneliness. There
were great allowances, after all, which she would gladly
make for him. She knew all about his life now. She
knew <em>him</em>, too—just how stimulating a little praise was
to him, just how diffident he was about himself, and
how hard it was for anyone to reach his real open self.
As she sat there beside him and watched his strong,
splendid profile, while he gazed at the river, she knew
that she could never pity him. He was too big and
strong. To-day was but a passing mood in his strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
life. Rather than comfort him she would prefer to cast
her inmost self upon his support and be comforted.
But he was too immovable either to come to her or to
receive her.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a bone to pick, Mauney,” she said.</p>

<p>“All right. What is it?” he asked pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Can’t you imagine?”</p>

<p>“Possibly, but I’d prefer that you present the bone.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you call me up all week?”</p>

<p>“My easiest excuse would be that I did not think you
cared.”</p>

<p>“But,” she answered, “as we happen to be sensible
people of the twentieth century, and as you <em>know</em> I
cared, tell me your real reason.”</p>

<p>“Would work be a decent excuse?” he laughed.</p>

<p>“With anyone else but you, Mauney, it would do
fine. But you must remember that I’ve only got three
more weeks, perhaps, to stay in Lockwood.”</p>

<p>“But three weeks is a long time, too, Freda,” he said,
seriously. “Just think how terribly much can happen
in three weeks.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re thinking of history, are you?” she
asked in a delicate tone of mockery.</p>

<p>“No, Freda,” he replied, quickly. “I’m thinking of
you. I’m thinking of you all the time, all this week.
Please do me the honor to believe me.”</p>

<p>“Sorry,” she said, dropping her hand suddenly on
his.</p>

<p>Her week of impatience quickly melted from her
thoughts, and in the silence, as they sat so close together,
she could have wept. Why had she used that little,
mocking tone? If he could realize how she felt he
would take her hand in his and not leave it just where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
she had dropped it. But there he sat looking away toward
the river, so very self-contained.</p>

<p>“And I was going to tell you,” he said presently,
“about the young people I’m teaching. I like them all
right and I think they have unusual ability. But they
have no enthusiasm, except a very few of them. I decided
that I’d like to start a seminary for one of the
classes where we could get right down to business and
have open discussions. Don’t you think that’s a good
idea?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mauney, splendid,” she replied, lifting her hat
carefully from her head, and tossing it on the grass.
“Why don’t you do it?”</p>

<p>“Just one reason. Dover, when I put it up to him,
didn’t think it could be done. I talked it over with him
in his office, Friday night. He’s a good fellow and
capable and has got a line on Lockwood that I wish
you’d heard. He impressed on me that his words were
confidential, but I’m going to tell you. He approved
of the round-table idea immediately, but said it had
once been tried out, and failed. They had to be held
after regular classes, you see, and a lot of the wealthy
people objected to their children being kept in. They
sent doctor’s certificates and raised the devil. Of course,
once robbed of its spontaneity, the seminaries proved a
failure.”</p>

<p>“Enthusiasm,” said Freda, “is one word that dear old
Lockwood will never learn. They hate enthusiasm.”</p>

<p>“You should have seen Dover,” laughed Mauney.
“When he grows warm under the collar he always gets
on those two feet of his and hikes all over the room,
like a madman looking for a hole by which to escape
from his cell.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>“He was just the same when I went,” she nodded.</p>

<p>“I had touched a tender spot when I mentioned seminaries,”
Mauney continued. “It got him off on a general
criticism of Lockwood. After he had paced the
floor for a moment or two he stopped and said in his
slow, nasal, sarcastic way: ‘Mr. Bard, I’ve lived here
for twenty-five years. That’s exactly a quarter of a
century, and I’m going to tell you that it’s been exactly
a quarter of a century too long. I don’t know what’s
wrong with Lockwood, because I’ve been much too busy
to try to find out.’”</p>

<p>“That sounds just like him!” laughed Freda.</p>

<p>“‘But, there’s something wrong, I can assure you. A
teacher who teaches in this town, is just a paid servant
of the community. He has no social status, whatever.
His wife has none either. His planetary orbit reaches
as far as school at nine in the morning, and as far as
bed at nine in the evening. If he tries to do more than
he’s paid for he becomes unpopular. They want uniformity,
here in Lockwood and, by George, they’re going
to get it. That’s why seminaries won’t work, Mister
Bard.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” Freda said, “you mustn’t be discouraged,
boy.”</p>

<p>Mauney shook his head slowly while the muscles of
his jaw hardened. “I’m far from being discouraged,”
he said quietly. “I’ve started in on this work, and I’m
going to stay with it.”</p>

<p>There, in that simple statement of his, Freda felt
that his whole reliable character showed itself. Born
of parents who had dug their living out of the ground,
Mauney would persist in whatever task he undertook—obdurate,
stubborn, steadfast and gloriously reliable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>They had supper at the Chalet and then returned to
their nook under the trees. Freda had, by this time, attuned
herself to the quiet and dispirited mood which
seemed to possess Mauney. It would pass, she felt,
but it was lasting unusually long.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t come to see you this week,” he said awkwardly.
“I got a letter from the nurse at Rockland,
and Max is dying.”</p>

<p>“Dying!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>He nodded his head slowly several times. That was
all the explanation he could give for his conduct during
the past week, and it had taken him all day to give
it. They drove home in the twilight and later, on the
verandah at MacDowell’s, as he was bidding her good-night,
the illumination of a red moon shining through
a hot, smoky, sky showed him her face. Never would
he forget the quietness of that moment, disturbed only
by the wind in the pines, as he looked down upon her
features, and suffered to clasp the vision in his arms.
But he did not.</p>

<p>And when he had gone, Freda, unable to understand
his restraint, suffered, too. Idealization was a bogey
cast out of heaven years ago. She coveted actuality and
the simple, sweet rewards of affection, and, in a pang
of loneliness, she wished that Mauney was less immovable

<span class="smcap">The Music of Silence and of Drum.</span></h3>

<p>There was a depth in Freda’s nature which she was
sure no one would ever discover. A delicate
fear occasionally separated her from people for an hour
of tranquil meditation, in which she reached back
through time and down through obstructions to regain
touch with it herself. Sometimes she would paddle
slowly along the shore near her home, or, beaching
the canoe on the meagre shelf by the cliff’s feet, sit
in passive enjoyment of the simple natural objects
about her. She never took a book on these solitary
excursions, because of a characteristic impulse toward
actuality. The flat, round stones and pebbles, rendered
smooth by years of the river’s polishing, may have been
very uninteresting and inanimate things, indeed, but
she loved the amazing variation in their color, all dim,
composite shades of purples, greens and nameless greys.
There was a silence, not encroached upon by the monotonous
murmur of the persistent shore waters, and a
solitude unaffected by distant freighters moving slowly
in the midstream. She would stretch supinely to gaze
at the nervous phantoms of reflected light that pendulated
upon the cavernous, stratified face of the cliffs,
or to watch a fisher-bird perched attentively on a bare,
protruding root, far up at the grassy edge above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>Her ears, attuned to disregard the soft sounds that
formed about her an atmospheric velvet, began at length
to hear that wondrous roaring silence that ever widened
and thrilled with the very mystery of all mysteries.
And she knew, but could never have explained, what
else she found then. It was strength and rare forgetfulness
of self, and belief in a vast Something that
could never henceforth be doubted.</p>

<p>This, however, constituted for Freda merely that ultimate
spiritual experience, painfully unapproachable by
friends, which it is the strange lot of all mortals to
know less or more. Men and women cling to it, hunger
for it, recover it or lose it, but for ever treasure it.
The gratifications of a hundred vaunted pursuits dissipate
into shadow-play before it. And yet it is what?
So elusive, so stupendous, so readily forgotten. The
trammelling events of a world constantly with us, march
upon us, swoop us into their caravanserie, and we are
no longer the living strength of that incomparable hour.
We are but the dutiful perpetuators of age-old customs
and follies.</p>

<p>Back to life, as it was, and with an impetuous relish,
went Freda, on the night of the dance.</p>

<p>It was no disloyalty to Mauney. Her nature surged
energetically on both sides of the line of average experience.
If there were moments of spiritual joy, there
were also moments of blinder joy, when music inspired
the sinews and the blood warmed. Life was so large
that it could not remember from hour to hour its past
occupations. Eyes that loved soft, verdant light at the
river’s edge, must love, too, the carnival display of garish
crimsons and yellows; ears that had listened into
the silence heard now the barbaric tune of drum and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
trumpet with enhanced sensation. This gaiety was not
disloyalty to Mauney. It was merely life—her life—that
craved the thrills. She thought, as she pirouetted
with Courtney, that the delectable exercise was indeed
a necessary training. It made her love Mauney more.
Taught by its care-free spirit, she would be better able
to cheer that dependable man, who lived a life curbed
constantly to the line of average emotions. With a
fresher attraction she would decoy him from the inevitable,
but wearing, sombreness of his lonely existence.</p>

<p>And then, too, as she half-meditated, the while her
feet were gliding in accurate rhythm with her partner,
Mauney could not really blame her. He had stubbornly
withheld the final declarations and demands that would
have made her his fiancée. And he had left her alone
for a whole week. Reason, noble reason he had, no
doubt. But she would value love that broke past all
reasons; and now, if he learned that she had gone dancing
with Courtney, the discovery might rouse him, by
jealousy or caution, to that pitch of emotion where
she longed to behold him. And, if he disapproved, he
had only to discipline, to satisfy her.</p>

<p>Many of Lockwood’s elite thought that Freda and
Courtney made a striking pair, and said so. He was
well known to have many attractions, some of them
popular, some not. As a matrimonial prize he had been
variously encouraged by several ambitious mothers;
then given up, but never scorned. He enjoyed that kind
of popularity which is inspired by wealth and ease, enhanced
by a pleasant enough personality, but which is
restrained by an envious bitterness seldom expressed.
The wealthy are aware of such bitterness, but have
learned to disregard it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>As for Freda, she was now practically a visitor in
Lockwood society. A few years before she had been
a beautiful and popular debutante, with an influential
father. She was now a university woman, and her
people, though not so influential as before, were still
definitely well considered. To-night she was merely
an admittedly beautiful and acceptable young lady.
Society was not keenly interested in her.</p>

<p>“I think,” said Mrs. Turnbull to Mrs. Squires, as they
watched the dancing from the verandah, “that Miss
MacDowell looks so graceful with Ted.”</p>

<p>“He knows a good dancer,” replied Mrs. Squires
with a supercilious expression. “But you know, of
course, that his mother, who is in New York, would
scarcely approve if she were here.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” enquired Mrs. Turnbull, with the seriousness
due to a most important issue.</p>

<p>“No reason, except that the MacDowell’s are scarcely—ah—what
they were once, you know. And besides,
I presume that Ted is expected to aim higher.”</p>

<p>“Is he serious about Freda MacDowell?” Mrs. Turnbull
asked in surprise.</p>

<p>“He was once, my dear, and Mrs. Courtney is known
to have cut Freda rather cruelly on several occasions.”</p>

<p>Freda, had she heard such remarks, would have been
quite indifferent. The dance was the thing. It was the
glory of movement and sound and color that charmed
her. Courtney was but a means to an end—an impersonal
partner who lived up to the character with his
customary gentility. But Courtney was not quite impregnable.
The intoxication of Freda’s proximity had
been making inroads on his polite reserve, and gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
culminated in a little outburst as they stood alone on a
deserted part of the verandah during a number.</p>

<p>“Girl, I love you!” he whispered passionately and
tried to embrace her. But she pushed him back steadily.</p>

<p>“Ted, you do not,” she replied angrily. “You just
imagine it, and I don’t like your arms on me, either!
You may take me home, please!”</p>

<p>He bowed and went so directly for his car that Freda
half forgave him. He told her on the way home that
his only regret over the incident was her displeasure.
He hoped that she might soon give him some slight
reason to be less unhappy than he was just then. If
she could not in any case entertain his serious bid for
love, he would gladly content himself with the consolation
of her friendship. Would she not, at least, forgive
him for to-night?</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Ted,” she replied, as he was about
to leave her. “I didn’t like it one little bit.”</p>

<p>Nor did she.</p>

<p>In her room she engaged in an intense mood of
self-despising, and anger and regret. Ah! She wanted
Mauney’s arms just then. Her sense of guilt melted
into one of weakness and dependence. In his strong,
clean arms she would be at last peaceful and safe. She
ought not to have gone with Courtney. That was
plain. But she had promised. Now she would confess
to Mauney and accept his chastisement with delicious
satisfaction.</p>

<h3 id="IV_CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="smcap">The St. Lawrence Hears a Dialogue.</span></h3>

<p>The next evening Mauney called at MacDowell’s
and had his first encounter with Freda’s father.
He found him comfortably seated with a newspaper on
the verandah. As Mauney approached, MacDowell’s
sharp, black eye surveyed him over the corner of his
journal. Then he removed his feet from the low wicker
table.</p>

<p>“Good evening, sir,” he said politely, rising and extending
his hand. “Come right up. I ought to have
met you before, Mr. Bard,” he continued with a mischievous
smile, “but better late than not at all. It’s
warm, isn’t it? There’s a chair. I don’t know what’s
going to happen if it doesn’t soon rain. We usually
have a breath of air from the river here, but this
last week, I’ve been sweltering.”</p>

<p>“And what has surprised me, Mr. MacDowell,” said
Mauney, “is the general impression that Lockwood is
such ‘a cool, breezy, summer resort.’”</p>

<p>“So it is,” MacDowell affirmed. “This is exceptional
heat. You can go a long piece before you’ll find a town
whose situation, general lay-out, and climate can even
compare with this wonderful little town.”</p>

<p>“It’s funny, though,” rejoined Mauney, “how many
knockers are to be found among its citizens. I’ve been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
here only a couple of weeks, and I’ve noticed that the
lower and middle classes—for I think the divisions are
pretty distinct—are constantly fault-finding and grouching.”</p>

<p>“No doubt, no doubt,” MacDowell nodded, while his
face reassumed the special enthusiastic expression which
he always wore when praising his town. “Let them
talk! But I’m going to tell you, Mr. Bard, that this
town, out of the whole province, has, without exception,
the most brilliant future before it. Some day
you’re going to see that river alive with commerce and
our harbor crowded with freighters. The population
is going to jump up, internal trade will flourish, the
community will become permanently prosperous. And
all this, once some big industry sees the advantage of
locating here. It’s no myth. It’s bound to come.”</p>

<p>Mauney liked the big man for his enthusiasm. He
was inspired, as most people were who talked with
MacDowell, by a new belief in Lockwood. After all,
why should it not grow and prosper and become a city?
There was the river, indeed; that great, potential artery
of commerce, with its undeveloped water-power. And
here was Lockwood, sure enough, strategically situated,
and upon the very brink of an undeniably great future.
Some personal magnetism of his host had conjured up
the vision before him and taught him faith. He felt
all at once a deep respect for the masterly man who,
at this moment, although unnoticed, was smiling slyly
at Mauney’s serious face. MacDowell was at last clear
to him: he was remaining in Lockwood because of his
faith. He was tied to the old town by invisible bonds
of strong affection and belief. Let them talk! Here
was an heroic figure, a man of brave judgment and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
great dreams. Mauney could not have been persuaded,
just then, that his hero’s dream was simply a lifelong
adoration of Gloria Smith, and that his skilful role
was but the disguise of a private loyalty. Later he
would learn, perhaps, that MacDowell was, of all municipal
students, the most confirmed pessimist, but that
would never hinder him from liking the genial man
and feeling that in some degree he redeemed Freda’s
home from hopeless frigidity.</p>

<p>At last Freda came out of the house, and seemed surprised
to see Mauney. While they were talking her
father interrupted good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“Look here, you folks, why don’t you take out the
canoe for a paddle along the shore?”</p>

<p>“You have a very fertile imagination, Dad,” said
Freda.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he agreed dryly, “and a desperate determination
not to be ousted from this verandah.”</p>

<p>His suggestion was adopted, and together they
crossed the rough tableland to the steps leading down
to the boat-house, exchanging not a word as they went.</p>

<p>“I telephoned last night, Freda,” Mauney said as he
began to follow her down the steps.</p>

<p>“What time did you ’phone?” she asked, pausing as
she reached the first landing.</p>

<p>“I think it was about nine, and your mother said
you had gone to a dance.”</p>

<p>Freda stood by the railing, looking away to the river
as he reached the landing. She said nothing, but displeasure
was written openly on her face. She had been
looking forward to making her own confession of the
gentle guilt. She had imagined herself saying: “I was
a very wayward girl last night, Mauney,” and him listening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
thoroughly vexed. But he had spoiled that anticipation
by knowing all about it.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, with a haughty elevation of her
brows, “wasn’t that all right?”</p>

<p>“Of course, it was all right, Freda,” he replied.
“But I had heard nothing about the dance, you see.”</p>

<p>“Hadn’t you <em>really</em>!” she exclaimed with more sarcasm
than she felt.</p>

<p>“No,” he replied quietly, but with a puzzled glance
at her cheek which, though turned away, was suddenly
very red. “I have no authority over what you do,
Freda, and even if I had, I wouldn’t use it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose you would, Mauney. I suppose you’d
<em>always</em> just let me do as I wanted to.”</p>

<p>“You’re quite right. But I was surprised last night,
and a little bit hurt.”</p>

<p>“Well, I knew you would be,” she admitted, turning
slightly towards him.</p>

<p>“And I just want to know,” he continued, “if you’re
always going to do things that hurt.”</p>

<p>“How do I know?” she retorted, facing him. “If
you don’t like things I do, why then, you’ve got to discipline
me.”</p>

<p>“Discipline you!” he exclaimed. “Why I hadn’t even
thought of disciplining you.”</p>

<p>“Because,” she interrupted without heeding his words,
“I don’t know what it is that sometimes plays the devil
with me, and I’ve <em>got</em> to be disciplined. I’ve been like
a boat without a rudder. My greatest need has been
for some one to steer me.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, Freda, who were you with at the dance?”</p>

<p>“Ted Courtney,” she quickly answered.</p>

<p>His eyes opened wide, then grew thoughtful. “Do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
you mean that he—that Courtney took you to the
dance?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>He was silent a moment, studying the palm of his
hand. “But I never dreamed that you even liked him,”
he said at length.</p>

<p>“I don’t either, Mauney.”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” he said in a lower tone, as he leaned his
hips against the railing and folded his arms on his
breast, “I suppose it’s really your business and not
mine. Don’t imagine that I’m trying to interfere in
your affairs.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goodness, no,” she almost jeered. “I’m afraid
there’s not much danger of your ever interfering the
least bit! Why, Mauney, I don’t mind if you give me
the very devil for going to that dance!”</p>

<p>“Only tell me. Why did you go with Courtney?” he
asked with a deliberation that provoked her.</p>

<p>“There are just about forty-seven reasons,” she stated
with thin grace. “First, because I knew I shouldn’t,
second, because at the time he asked me I was furious
with you for not calling me up for a whole week, third
because I wanted to do something to relieve my fury.”</p>

<p>“But, I told you,” he interrupted in a quiet, polite
tone, “I told you why I didn’t call you up.”</p>

<p>“You told me after I had promised to go to the
dance.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you don’t understand,” he said, gently, taking
off his straw hat and turning the rim slowly around
between his hands. “It was not the dance. Can’t you
understand my feelings?”</p>

<p>“I understand them only too well.” Her dark eyes
were now burning almost savagely, and her hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
tightly gripping the balustrade. She spoke in an unnaturally
restrained tone. “It’s Max Lee, of course,
I’ve tried to feel sorry about him being ill. Perhaps I
ought to be trying to comfort you. If so—too bad. I’m
just being true to my feelings, that’s all. You had to
be so thoughtful of that man, didn’t you, Mauney? Had
to let him down so very, very easily. You couldn’t let
him die like a man, unhappy and miserable, but <em>like</em> a
man you had to smooth out his path for him. Even if
he did love me, which I doubt, he knew I didn’t love
him. What difference did he make anyway? Why
allow your care for him to make you slight me? Even
if Lee <em>is</em> dying,” she concluded emphatically, “that’s
not half as dramatic as it looks. There are other people
who are <em>living</em>—or trying to!”</p>

<p>“But he’s been <em>my</em> pal, <em>my</em> friend, Freda,” he
answered very calmly, “and I’m afraid that you’d have
to be a man to quite appreciate my feelings.”</p>

<p>It was nothing apparently. Mauney seemed quite unperturbed.
As Freda stood regarding his reposeful
figure she wondered what she could possibly do to stir
him up. Even rudeness to a dying man—for it was
that—had not brought the storm she expected. Even
scorn of his solicitude for a dying friend—for her words
had been that, too—had failed to budge him an inch.
And now he was there before her, leaning against the
railing, reflectively flipping his finger at the lining of
his hat, as if she had merely remarked upon the brilliance
of the sinking sun, or the character of the
weather.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you curse me?” she asked presently. “I
doubt if you have any feelings. Why don’t you simply
kill me for what I said?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>“In the first place,” he smiled, “I don’t think you
quite meant it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I did,” she affirmed. “I really did.”</p>

<p>“Come on,” he said in a lighter tone, catching her
hand and starting down the second flight of steps. “If
I were to kill you, Freda MacDowell, it would be a
tough little world for me to go on living in.”</p>

<p>“Anyway,” he added, drawing her gently along as she
made to grasp the railing. “I certainly did use you rottenly
last week. I can see now how you felt, and as
for that dance and our friend, Courtney, well—I’m not
going to be so miserably jealous any more.”</p>

<p>The edge of Freda’s knife-like mood was dulled a
little by his words, and she followed him with a sense
of defeat. It was becoming her ambition to see this
big fellow angry. Why a woman should desire such a
sight, and desire it like a fetish, is one of the obscure
phenomena of feminine psychology. To say that anger
reveals new qualities of the man is to give but a paltry
explanation. During the little canoe journey along under
the eastern shore of Lockwood, Freda kept thinking
of Gertrude Manton’s apothegm: “We don’t
know why our love makes us hurt them. They are
only men, but we are women.” But had Gertrude
really managed to hurt them? That was the question.
If so, unbounded praise! As for herself, Freda
was ignobly defeated. The man at whose sure stroke
her canoe glided so sleekly under the shadowy cliffs
was surely incapable of anger.</p>

<h3 id="IV_CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="smcap">Distress.</span></h3>

<p>It would always require a longer time for Mauney
to become roused than for most people, in any vital
matter. He would be sure to react very slowly to the
irritating stimuli. He would gain cognizance of issues
very tardily, and keep on half-doubting things that he
hated to believe.</p>

<p>Friday, at noon, he crossed Church Street, from the
collegiate to his boarding house, conscious of only one
thing, that the morning’s work had been utterly unsatisfactory.
Just why his discipline over his classes had
weakened he was not ready even now to enquire. The
faces of half a hundred students can be very unfriendly
at times. They can act as a unified mirror to throw
back at a teacher the gloom, the uncertainty, the desperate
undercurrent of his own mood. There had been
slight lapses of memory when those inquisitive faces
had roused him to complete the phrases almost escaped.
No doubt he had appeared to them stupidly absent-minded.
In the principal’s office there had been a queer
conversation, too. Dover had only been explaining
some detail of routine, but he had worn an expression
of impatient emphasis, as though he were trying to impress
an idiot. That, too, had been due, no doubt, to
Mauney’s own preoccupation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p>Noon recess on this Friday marked the end of the
week’s work. A half-holiday had been granted for
some reason or other—preparation for field-day, now
that he thought of it. He entered his room with a
grateful sense of finding at last shelter and opportunity
to think.</p>

<p>He knew that these bright days, with streets flooded
by dry, hard sunlight were important and sombre days.
Other people seemed to be free of care. Field sports
and picnics up the river, and long, refreshing drives
along the river road—these enjoyments were not, and
could not be, for him. Nor was this September so
much different from all his past autumns. Each fall
had found him enmeshed in difficulties. He was beginning
to perceive that his life lay just outside the
border of the sunlight. And that, unprofitable though
all his problems might be, they were, nevertheless, undeniably
with him. He could not shirk them. Perhaps
some strength might be gained in the effort to
solve them. At any rate he realized quite clearly, as
he removed his coat and tossed it on the bed, that the
problem to-day was Freda MacDowell.</p>

<p>First of all he would shave. He had no sooner
poured a little water into the basin on the washstand
than the landlady knocked on his door.</p>

<p>“Come in, Mrs. Hudson,” he said wearily.</p>

<p>As she entered, clothed as usual in her plain, print
gown, his eyes focused on a yellow envelope in her hand.</p>

<p>“It’s a telegraph,” she announced officiously, but without
proffering it. “And it’s afther coming while ye
were at the schule, Mister Bard. Poor mon! I due
hope as it is nothin’ alarming. It’s the sight of a telegraph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
that I due dhread, Mister Bard. For wanse, several
years ago, I did receive wan meself.”</p>

<p>“But it may be nothing,” said Mauney cheerfully, as
he reached for it.</p>

<p>“Ah, but it’s a telegraph, mind!” she insisted, while
her eyes keenly studied her boarder’s face as he tore
it open and began reading. She preserved silence until
he had finished, but her curiosity kept her standing,
huge and peering, by the open door. She noticed his
blue eyes scan the message hurriedly, then again several
times more slowly. Finally he looked up over the edge
of the paper with wide, blank eyes. He was conscious
of her enormous body beside him and was irked by it.</p>

<p>“It’s nothing much, after all, Mrs. Hudson,” he said
in a low tone, starting once more to read it.</p>

<p>“Imogine, now!” she replied, “Indade, but sure, I
t’ought it would be afther bein’ a—”</p>

<p>Mauney, ignoring her presence, went to the window
and stood looking out on the street. Mrs. Hudson,
after a final assertion that “a telegraph” was never a
very welcome kind of missive, left and closed the door
angrily.</p>

<p>“Patient failed to regain consciousness; died quietly
six this morning.” That, with the nurse’s signature,
was the whole message. Mauney stood pensively by
the window wondering why he received the news so
apathetically. It was unreal. It was unquestionably
true. But the external objects of this bright, Friday
noon wore a casual appearance that denied the occurrence
of death. Church Street was just the same innocent,
familiar thoroughfare. There were the groups
of collegiate students hurrying along with books in
their arms, laughing and talking. There was the doubled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
old man, white-bearded and feeble, plodding down the
walk, rapping the cement sharply with his metal-headed
stick, and nearby, in the shade of a maple, lay the neighbor’s
familiar Airedale, mouth open and tongue protruding,
as he panted in the heat.</p>

<p>Turning back into the room he slowly walked to his
trunk and opened it. Then he folded the telegram
quickly and put it in one of the compartments of the
tray. As he closed the lid slowly he cleared his throat,
and then set to work shaving. He tried, as faithfully
as possible, to take an interest in his personal toilet,
but found it quite a boring procedure. There was a
new grey suit, hanging on the back of the door, to be
worn for the first time to-day, and although it was
very becoming, he took no pleasure in it. He was going
down to the MacDowell’s this afternoon to hear
some expert piano music. Freda had telephoned him
before school that Betty Doran, home from New York,
was going to give a private recital to a few friends.
Just who Betty Doran was he neither knew nor cared.
What she was going to play he had not heard, nor was
he in the least curious.</p>

<p>In fact, only one thing mattered—to-day, to-morrow
or at any time—that he could conceive. That particular,
important thing was a long talk with Freda, a talk
which would have consequences. It would definitely
end all misunderstandings, and rob her, once and for
all, of any doubt about his love.</p>

<p>When he arrived at the MacDowell’s he found himself
a neglected member of a gathering of thirty. Betty
Doran, a spoiled young person of eighteen with Dutch-cut
hair, sat at the piano rendering Chopin brilliantly
and smiling affectedly at the frequent applause of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
audience who filled the drawing-room. There was cake
and coffee to be served afterwards, but Freda, who had
taken a vow never to assist her mother with afternoon
refreshments, stubbornly refused now, much to the
remarked surprise of guests who saw her talking quietly
with Mauney just outside in the hallway.</p>

<p>“This is about the last place I should have wished
to come to-day,” he was saying to her in a low tone.
“Get me out of it, Freda. And, if you can get away
this evening, I’m crazy to take you for a long drive out
in the country. Are you free?”</p>

<p>She gladly agreed.</p>

<p>After the recital was finished and the last loquacious
woman had finally bade the hostess good-bye, she turned
quickly from the door and sought her daughter.</p>

<p>“It’s simply terrible,” she said with evident feeling,
“that this Bard person should have been asked to our
home to-day, and I must and do insist that in future,
if you are so foolish as to see him at all—”</p>

<p>“Now, Mother,” said Freda with some curiosity,
“what on earth have the dear ladies been telling you?”</p>

<p>“Everybody knows it!” exclaimed Mrs. MacDowell.
“He has been seen on the street with Mrs. Poynton
and was also noticed coming out of her house.”</p>

<p>“Well, anything else?” Freda coolly enquired.</p>

<p>“I think that’s almost enough,” smiled her mother.
“No one is laboring under any delusions about Mrs.
Poynton, surely.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not, Mother,” Freda almost hissed, as,
blushing red, she drew quickly back with hatred in her
eyes. “Perhaps Mrs. Poynton was guilty of a sin you
and Mrs. Beecher will not forgive her for. Perhaps
it was a sin her husband will not forgive. I know nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
about her. I want to know nothing. But of one
thing I am absolutely certain!”</p>

<p>“And of what, my girl, are you so certain?” asked
her mother.</p>

<p>“That if Mauney Bard called at her home he did it
in innocence,” replied Freda, defiantly.</p>

<p>“Ha,” gently laughed the proud scion of Family-Compact
glory, “Your credulity is quite amazing. If you
care to believe what you say, you are, of course, at
liberty to do so. You have always been full of strange
and reckless impulses.”</p>

<p>“I believe in him so much,” said Freda, with emphasis
that caused her voice to break, “that I’d stake everything—yes,
my life, on him. And you, Mother, without
even inquiring into it, are ready, just like the rest
of these fools, to throw your harpoon into an innocent
man.</p>

<p>“All I say,” replied her mother, haughtily, and with
an aggravating smile, “is that this home—my home—is
now closed to your glorious hero. I trust that is quite
plain?”</p>

<p>Freda could not speak. Her face suddenly grew
white as she stood in the middle of the dining-room
floor fastening vengeful eyes upon her mother.</p>

<p>“It was even reported,” continued Mrs. MacDowell,
turning to arrange some flowers in a vase on the buffet,
“that Mr. Bard spent the night at Mrs. Poynton’s.”</p>

<p>“It’s a lie—a damned lie!” burst forth Freda. “Oh,
tell me who said that!”</p>

<p>“No, I shall do nothing of the sort. Possibly you
can imagine that it was told me in a kindly spirit.”</p>

<p>“When—did they say he—did that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<p>“Last week, of course,” she replied. “When you were
wondering what had become of him.”</p>

<p>“Mother,” Freda said more calmly, “Mauney will
deny this for me. I know it’s all a hopeless lie, one of
the big, black lies that they love so much. You don’t
know him, Mother. You don’t even want to know him.
But let me tell you one thing, that you are as bad as
the rest of them!”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” smiled Mrs. MacDowell, turning from the
vase of flowers.</p>

<p>“You are worse than a murderer,” suddenly said
Freda, while her face quivered with new rage.</p>

<p>Mrs. MacDowell’s composure suffered a noticeable
weakening. “My girl, I shall not tolerate such language!”
she warned. “Be very careful.”</p>

<p>“You are capable of a crime more dastardly than
murder, because it requires no courage—”</p>

<p>“Enough!”</p>

<p>“No,” fumed Freda. “It’s not enough. You’re going
to hear it all for once. You have made me <em>hate</em> you.”</p>

<p>Something of latent power in her daughter’s manner
put Mrs. MacDowell on guard.</p>

<p>“Why, Freda,” she exclaimed. “What on earth. I
only meant to—”</p>

<p>“It’s what you’ve done that counts, Mother. I know
he’s innocent. My God, he must be innocent!”</p>

<p>Just a moment later George MacDowell came into the
room and found Freda in a chair with her head clasped
in her hands, weeping, and his wife standing, evidently
distressed. He looked from one to the other regretfully.
Sadness was in his black eyes as he looked accusingly
at his wife.</p>

<p>“Gloria,” he said. “I’m surprised. I’ve heard both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
sides of this case. I couldn’t miss it, by Gad. Look
what you’ve done. You’ve broken her heart. Are you
proud of your job? You women aren’t sports, I tell
you. Give her a fighting chance. Don’t stand there
gloating over it. This business of afternoon-tea scandals
has gone too far.”</p>

<p>“Why, George,” she said nervously, “I only meant to
warn her of—”</p>

<p>“But you’ve broken her up, completely. Now, look
here,” he said more seriously than she had ever heard
him speak. “This is no small matter. Let’s get a little
British fair play into this business. Do you know what
I’m going to do?”</p>

<p>He brought his fist sharply into his opened palm.</p>

<p>“I’m going to get Mauney Bard. If he’s a man he’ll
stand his trial and either deny it or not.” He started
for the door, picking up his hat from a table nearby.
Then before leaving he turned. “Ladies,” he said. “I
will request you both to wait my return.”</p>

<p>“But, George,” said Mrs. MacDowell, “I think such
a thing is absurd.”</p>

<p>“And I don’t want it either,” said Freda.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re both a fine lot, by Gad,” said MacDowell,
impatiently tossing his hat to the table. “All
right. But one thing I insist on, Gloria, and that is
that you immediately govern your tongue. This is your
house, but it is my home and this is my daughter.”</p>

<p>MacDowell sauntered slowly back to the library, while
his wife somewhat informed as to new qualities in her
married partner, departed quickly for the kitchen and began
making unnecessary noise with the dishes. Freda proceeded
to her room and was not seen again until eight
in the evening, when she came down and passed through,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
without speaking, on her way to the garage. They
heard the rumble of the motor-car and both watched,
from different vantage points, as it sped quickly between
the pine trees on its way to Queen Street. During the
evening, while MacDowell in the library, as Mayor of
Lockwood, gave audience to some business men from
Merlton, his wife sat playing solitaire on the southern
verandah.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="IV_CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="smcap">What Yellow Eyes Saw.</span></h3>

<p>Freda was so quiet as she and Mauney drove along
the river road and so unusually unresponsive to
his remarks, that he began to wonder if he had discovered
her in another of her unpredictable moods. For
some time he, too, was silent.</p>

<p>“Well, Freda,” he said at length, with forced cheerfulness,
“suppose we both loosen up for a change. That
musicale was pretty nearly too much for me, and I
suppose it affected you in the same way. These last
two weeks have been about the least satisfactory passage
in my life, so far, and if I were to give in to my
feelings I would be a rare study in despondency.”</p>

<p>“Lockwood blues!” said Freda, dismally, as she slowly
stopped the car by the side of the road. “It’s bound to
get you. However, we’ve got to go on living, and I
hear that you’ve been showing some attentions to a
married woman.”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” laughed Mauney, good-naturedly, “and who
is the favored lady?”</p>

<p>“This isn’t such a laughing matter as it looks,
Mauney,” she replied with some severity. “My mother’s
wild about it.”</p>

<p>“About what?”</p>

<p>For an instant she tugged at her gloves and removed
them. “I wish,” she said, “that I were feeling a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
happier than I am. I’ll tell you what it’s all about.
You were said to have been seen on the street with
Mrs. Poynton, and also leaving her house one evening.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s true enough,” admitted Mauney as he
waited for her to continue.</p>

<p>“Then you <em>were</em> with her?” asked Freda quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes, why not?” he asked with a puzzled frown.
“Isn’t she all right?”</p>

<p>“God knows whether she’s all right or not, but she’s
got a horrible reputation.”</p>

<p>“Jean Byrne!” exclaimed Mauney, incredulously.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she nodded impatiently. “Mrs. Poynton has
been very injudicious. I have never really interested myself
in the details and I hate saying such things about anyone,
but I simply couldn’t believe that you had associated
yourself with her in any way. But now that you admit
it I suppose I am obliged to tell you more. It’s
all over town that you stayed at her house all night.”</p>

<p>Mauney’s mouth opened to speak. Then his face
suddenly grew pale and he gazed in silence past her
head into the woods that rose at the side of the road.</p>

<p>“Well, aren’t you going to deny it?” she asked in
a tone of surprise.</p>

<p>“Surely I don’t need to?” he said a little angrily.
“Surely you don’t believe them?”</p>

<p>“If I were eighteen I’d say no. But I’m twenty-six,
unfortunately. And still more unfortunately, some
things are true no matter how much we don’t believe
them. I think,” she added precisely, “it’s only a fair
proposition that you should either deny it or make some
intelligent explanation.”</p>

<p>Mauney’s face, as it lowered slightly towards his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
breast, was that of a man for whom the light of the
world had suddenly gone out.</p>

<p>“And I’m afraid,” he said calmly, but with clear
decision, “that I will never do either.”</p>

<p>“But, don’t you see,” she asked with perceptible concern,
“that I would not demand it, except that it has
been put up to me strongly?”</p>

<p>“I can see nothing,” he replied slowly, “but an unbeautiful
lack of faith.”</p>

<p>Freda had turned her head away, so that Mauney
did not see the dawning light of wide-eyed fear, nor
the quiver of infinite regret.</p>

<p>For a moment she remained thus, and when roused
by the shuffling of his feet she turned again, he was
stepping from the car.</p>

<p>“I know you will pardon me,” he said. “But under
the circumstances, and with this scandal over my head,
I cannot allow you to be seen with me in public.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t!” She tried to speak, but further words
would not come. She saw him lift his hat and, turning
away, walk slowly down the road. It had all happened
so quickly that she could scarcely believe her eyes. What
had she done?</p>

<p>For a moment she watched his retreating figure.
Then, with decision to turn the car after him, she settled
behind the wheel and adjusted the spark lever preparatory
to starting the engine. But her hands, obeying
some vague instinct, dropped to her lap. His leave-taking
had been so final—and she was a woman! She
turned again in the seat and watched him as he went.
How could he leave her so abruptly. Surely the trouble
between them had been entirely upon the surface. Surely
he misunderstood her. This superficial mood of hers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
that demanded explanations, was but a vexatious billow.
Underneath lay the sea of her love. She did not believe
a word of the wretched scandal. Neither now, nor before.
He was innocent, of course. What had she
done?</p>

<p>A car was approaching and Freda automatically
started her engine and turned her motor to the road.
Slowly she moved along the smooth tarvia surface,
crawling like a guilty thing farther away from Lockwood.
She wanted to turn about, drive quickly back,
and, drawing up beside him, make amends. But her car
seemed to be possessed of a will of its own. It kept
straight on into the country, while Freda put forth a
futile effort to wring decision from the jumbled
thoughts in her mind. Above all considerations, a new
fear was possessing her.</p>

<p>“I know; I know it,” something said within her. He
had turned away from her with an air of finality—that
man who was so hard to move. During the past
week he had stubbornly resisted her whimsical tantalizations.
Facing her conscious weapons of provocation,
he had remained self-contained. But to-night, almost
without knowing it, she had moved him, indeed.
And Mauney, with his great inertia, once moved, would
maintain an irrevocable motion. It was thus, she felt.</p>

<p>Her knowledge of his personal difficulties had taught
her a glorious admiration that now changed to a quite
tender pity; and the thought of having added to them
brought up self-hate that tortured her almost intolerably.</p>

<p>Yet, although it would be seemingly simple enough
now to double back on her course and assure him of
her trust, she realized how strangely paralyzed her will
power had become. One emotion will lead to definite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
action. But she was now possessed of a dozen sharp
emotions that baffled her and rendered her uniquely
powerless to act. As she drove on very slowly, unconscious
of time, there occurred a gradual balancing and
checking off of these various feelings, until, at length,
she knew only that, by her own words and attitude,
she had killed love in the man she reverenced, and that
he was now suffering. Finally, when she turned about
and drove homeward, her mind had clarified her feelings
until nothing remained but a wild regret. Half
stupefied she entered her father’s gateway and ran the
car into the garage.</p>

<p>When she walked into the house, she found her father
sitting in the library, reading.</p>

<p>“Where’s Mother?” she asked.</p>

<p>“She’s over at Beecher’s,” he replied. “Why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing.”</p>

<p>She stood in the library door, stupidly looking at
him huddled behind his newspaper. The house was very
quiet. He was engrossed with the journal. She heard
the ticking of a clock in a bedroom upstairs. Her
father sat with one foot crossed over the other in such
a way that his trouser leg was pulled to reveal his grey
sock. She noticed that the design on the sock, woven
there with black thread, was broken and that some of
the threads were standing at loose ends.</p>

<p>Suddenly the rattle of the newspaper startled her.
“What’s wrong?” he asked, glancing up.</p>

<p>“Nothing, Dad,” she said, turning towards the hallway.</p>

<p>“Did you want your mother?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>She walked quickly to the telephone, raised her hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
to take down the receiver, then hesitated. She knew
that it would be a simple matter to telephone to Mauney.
It was only ten o’clock. And so much depended, it
seemed, on her telephoning to him just now. Dropping
upon the telephone stool she placed her hand again
on the receiver and kept it there. She was quite unconscious
of her father’s presence nearby. The only
thought in her mind was that Mauney was suffering.
It would be so easy to say: “Please come down; I
want to see you.” But her hand slowly relaxed and fell
into her lap. Her will power had strangely left her.</p>

<p>“I’m going to bed,” announced her father, coming
out into the hallway, yawning. As he reached the foot
of the staircase he paused. “By the way,” he said.
“There were a couple of important people down from
Merlton this evening, Freda!”</p>

<p>“Anything promising?” she asked vacantly.</p>

<p>“Nothing to the public, mind!” he smiled, raising
his hand in a gesture of caution. “But, between friends,
I’ll drop a word of cheer. These gentlemen are looking
for a site for a really big concern. They’ve got a
factory in their minds that covers ten acres and I let
’em know that Lockwood had that much ground for
them, too. Aren’t you tickled?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” nodded Freda automatically, although she
did not know what he had said. When he had gone
to his bedroom, she rose from the stool knowing that
she was quite incapable of telephoning to Mauney.</p>

<p>The house seemed quieter than it had ever been before.
Removing her sweater-coat, she literally pitched
it into a corner and went out on the verandah. Careless
of all but the wild regret that was torturing her
she dropped into a hammock and clasped her head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
with her hands. Whenever she glanced between her
fingers she saw the lawn with its dismal pines and a
faint mist that curled up over the edge of the cliff
nearby. The lights of the United States shore, usually
so bright, were shut out by a fog.</p>

<p>Presently, from the gateway next the street, two pencils
of brilliant light quivered against the pine trunks,
and, slowly swerving, illuminated the house, as a motor
car softly approached. The man who drove it saw the
verandah clearly and the form of a woman reclining in
the hammock. She had evidently thrown herself down
very carelessly, for her black stocking stood out in bold
contrasts with the yellow hammock. Edward Courtney
followed down the graceful lines to her ankle and to
the neat patent-leather Oxford, whose tip barely rested
on the floor. Having finished his admiring inspection
he sounded his horn blatantly and touched into silence
the soft purr of the motor as he drew near and stopped.</p>

<p>Freda sat quickly up.</p>

<p>“Want a spin?” he asked, turning toward her over
the side of the car.</p>

<p>“No, Ted,” she replied, “I don’t feel like it, thanks.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>Courtney got out and came up on the verandah.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” he remarked, helping himself to a chair,
“a person has to speak ahead these days, eh?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not in such demand as all that, Ted,” she
replied. “But I’m blue to-night.”</p>

<p>“Blue! Good Lord, girl, that’s tough. You need
cheering. And I’m an awfully good cheerer, too.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he leaned back in his chair so that the
light from the dining-room window struck fair upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
his long, pleasant face. Freda, whose first wish had
been that Courtney might just now find himself in hell
or any other place, but her verandah, suddenly felt
that, even in her present mood, human company was a
relief.</p>

<p>“Ted,” she said. “I wonder if you ever have a serious
thought in that head of yours.”</p>

<p>“Very seldom, Freda. This head has never ached
with an idea. Why should it? I’d rather have it ache
with sloe gin or curaçoa. An idea is so liable to turn
out to be weak-kneed, or revolutionary, or expensive,
and sloe gin is so simple and reliable.”</p>

<p>“I believe you’ve had some to-night,” she remarked
dryly. “Something has made you unusually bright.”</p>

<p>“I’ve had a thimbleful, I confess.”</p>

<p>“And you have the nerve to come over here to a
perfectly dry house without bringing some with you!”</p>

<p>“How stupid of me,” he smiled, slyly. “I thought
drinking was one of your pet aversions—”</p>

<p>“So it is; but I—”</p>

<p>“I almost hesitated to come on that account,” he
interrupted. “Bill Squires told me I was ‘canned,’ and
Betty Doran told me I was disqualified for polite society.
They’re over home, there, now, discussing the New York
theatre season with the mater. She landed in to-day
with a raft of new jazz stuff and a confounded jumping-jack
that won’t jump. Some beggar on Bryant
Square stuck her a quarter for it. Did I understand
you to say, Freda, that you would like a drink?”</p>

<p>Courtney produced a bottle from his coat pocket
and set it on the table near him.</p>

<p>“I didn’t bring any glasses,” he ventured.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” she said, rising. “That part is easy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
I think a drink will do me good this evening. I’ve
been half sick all day.”</p>

<p>The comfort that Freda derived from both Courtney
and the spirits was very meagre. He rambled on lightly
for a time, glass in hand, explaining how bored he
had become with Lockwood, and what a necessity existed
for some excitement or other.</p>

<p>Freda found that his essential vapidity was no solace,
but an irritant, and that her few draughts of sloe gin,
so far from wooing her away from the present woe,
seemed to clarify and emphasize it. While he talked,
she constantly reviewed her recent episode with Mauney,
and the flush of her cheeks, so vivid in the glare of
Courtney’s matches, depended less on gin than on a
growing mood of expostulation against the nature of
things. He, of course, would have been incapable, even
in his soberest moments, to divine or even recognize
her spiritual state, and could, therefore, be excused, at
present, for failing. When she began talking in a happier-sounding
tone, he did not know that a veritable
blaze of irresponsible temper had kindled. Thick of
ear, he missed the irony of her voice. Thicker of brain,
he took her words at their face value, unconscious of
the tremendous discount that existed.</p>

<p>“You’re a regular old dear, Ted,” she said. “What
would I ever do without you? You and your sloe gin!
You and your nice cars, Ted, and your yachts. Aren’t
you a darling old thing!”</p>

<p>“Glad to get a little appreciation,” he laughed. “Ever
since the dance I’ve been waiting to see you.” He
paused a moment. “Have you forgiven me yet, girl?”
he asked more seriously.</p>

<p>“You stupid boy! A woman always forgives a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
for falling in love with her. In fact,” she added
thoughtfully, “a woman will forgive anything in the
world, but suppression.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t suppress it, Freda!” he replied, leaning
toward her and resting his hand on hers. “I <em>had</em> to tell
you I loved you.”</p>

<p>“Really, Ted!” she answered flippantly. “Please go
on.”</p>

<p>“But you’re such a firebrand I never know how to
take you,” he confessed, “I never know what will please.
If I don’t warm up I think your eyes are despising me,
and if I do you suddenly teach me my place. And then
you tell me you’re practically engaged. Ah, well!” he
sighed, dropping his hand reluctantly to his side. “I’ll
try to be a platonic friend, though it’s a damned hopeless
business. What do you say to a moonlight trip
among the islands?”</p>

<p>“There’s no moon, Edward.”</p>

<p>“But we have strong imaginations.”</p>

<p>“Yes, too strong, I’m afraid. How would we go?”</p>

<p>“On the launch.”</p>

<p>For an instant Freda sipped from her glass, reflectively.</p>

<p>“You probably think I’m afraid to take you up on
that, Ted,” she said very calmly. “But you’re wrong
Go and get your launch and I’ll be waiting for you on
the steps of our boathouse.”</p>

<p>Courtney smoked quietly a moment without speaking.
As he rose, stretched himself, and walked toward
his roadster, Freda sat watching him. Not until he had
driven to the gate did she move a muscle. Then, with
a short, spasmodic sigh, she rose from the hammock
and entered the house. She had donned a sweater and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
a coat and was just coming out again to the verandah,
when her mother’s step was heard crunching the pebble
path.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” she asked, as she came up.</p>

<p>“For a breeze up the river,” Freda said, ill-temperedly.</p>

<p>“With whom?”</p>

<p>“Ted Courtney.”</p>

<p>“Well, are you aware of the time?”</p>

<p>“No, not very much.”</p>

<p>“And it’s a dark, foggy night,” continued Mrs. MacDowell,
with a glance towards the river. “It’s much
too late to—”</p>

<p>“Why, Mother,” laughed Freda, “it’s <em>never</em> late.
That’s just a conventional idea. Maybe the fog will
blow away in an hour or so, and the stars come out
and even the moon, too, for all we know.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want you to go, my girl,” she continued,
stepping nearer Freda, and peering critically into her
face.</p>

<p>“I haven’t worried much about your consent, Mother,
during the past few years, have I?” she asked crisply.
“Do you think I would begin to do so now—to-night?”</p>

<p>There was almost studied scorn in Freda’s carriage
as she stepped widely past her mother and left the verandah,
while Mrs. MacDowell stood watching her disappear
in the direction of the river.</p>

<p>Down at the boathouse, under the high cliff, she presently
awaited Ted’s coming. There were sights and
sounds here to beguile her impetuous thoughts. The
night was warm and her prophecy of moonlight came
true. From above the opposite shore the great, yellow
orb lifted with delicate tremblings, as if its sphere were
made of elastic substance. Its golden light caressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
the whimsical clouds of mist that scurried like steam
above the dull, green water. The waves lifted and fell,
but never broke, as if, on such a night, they were
anxious to be so gentle.</p>

<p>She sat perfectly still, knowing it was all madness,
but as determined as she ever had been about anything.
Then she turned her head thinking she heard the sound
of his launch. But she had not heard it. It came with
silent engines, like a sleek, white ghost, long and graceful,
emerging from the fog and slowing down as it
bent its course to sidle noiselessly closer and closer.
She stood up, shrinking back, half afraid, as if this
trim craft were not guided by human hands, but was
approaching like an event, exquisite, but inevitable.
She sprang then to the landing to clasp his hands as
he drew her aboard. “Freda, you’re wonderful,” she
heard him say, as the boathouse grew smaller, and the
nose of the launch bore out into the broad, grey, depths
of river and moon and mist.</p>

<p>No one knows how beautiful Lockwood is until he
sees it from a boat on a bright night. There are broad,
grey buildings whose massive stone faces shine like
frost. Lines of glimmering lamps stretch far along the
level thoroughfares and mark the streets that climb
steeply upward from the water. In the midst, clusters
of generous trees, motionless and black, send up, somewhere
from their indefinite mass, dark spires into the
soft, grey sky, while a tall clock-tower gazes with its
yellow eyes east and south and west. At midnight,
town and river are silent, save for the mournful chime
of the clock marking a new day. And one who hears
the message from the river finds a wistful, unspeakable
sadness in its tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span></p>

<p>The mists cleared to reveal a white craft floating
aimlessly in mid-stream. The moon threw into bold
sculpture a man and a woman who lounged in silence
there. Both were as still as the becalmed night, their
restlessness appeased as by a magic from the golden
moon. There were no words. In the woman’s heart
there was no happiness. It had not been love. It had
been wild regret and mad despair.</p>

<span class="smcap">What Was Inevitable.</span></h3>

<p>By the window of her room, opened to the river,
Freda remained all the rest of the night. There
was no soul near her. She watched the grey river until
the moon sank, and until the sun rose slowly from
behind the opposite shore. No one would ever understand
it. It was not the kind of sorrow that could be
confessed and forgotten. Something irrevocable had
controlled her fate. Now, so long as the world stood,
her heart would find no friend to learn its bitterness.
Deep in its inscrutable recesses suffering would call to
suffering and receive no answer. Alone, desperately
alone, she must stumble bravely before the inevitable
current that bears towards to-morrow.</p>

<p>But these night thoughts gradually surrendered their
poignancy to the bald light of growing day.</p>

<p>In the middle of the forenoon Mauney came to the
house.</p>

<p>She took him into the library, and pointed to a chair
beside the large French window that let in a blinding
shaft of sunshine.</p>

<p>“I hope I’ll be pardoned,” he said, “for coming down
so early.”</p>

<p>She made no reply, but watched him as he leaned forward
to gaze at the sunlight on the rug.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>“I still can’t think that you were honest last night,
Freda,” he continued. “I can’t think that you believe
this confounded scandal.”</p>

<p>“No, Mauney,” she answered sadly. “I never believed
it.”</p>

<p>“I can understand how you felt,” he admitted, “And
I ought not to have been so precipitate. I ought to have
denied it for you. I deny it now thoroughly and completely.
Jean Byrne was an old school teacher of mine.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mauney, you don’t need to explain. My faith
in you never faltered a minute at any time. I was only
afraid that I had hurt you.”</p>

<p>“You did, too,” he said, “But being hurt didn’t alter
the fact that I loved you, and that I love you right now
more than any thing on earth.”</p>

<p>He rose and walked to her chair.</p>

<p>“Freda,” he said tenderly, “I can’t go on living without
you. You are necessary to me. Tell me that you
care as little as I do about this scandal!”</p>

<p>“It’s nothing—just nothing,” she replied, rising and
walking to the window.</p>

<p>He followed her, and as he saw her white gown
rimmed with the strong sunshine, and her black hair
caught in a fringe of golden light his heart bounded.
Here before him was the living woman he loved. She
was his treasure.</p>

<p>“I have waited long enough,” he said, taking her hand.
“I have been a fool long enough, Freda. Our love is
deeper than such a petty misunderstanding.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said very softly, without turning from the
window, “It is deeper.”</p>

<p>With his hand on her shoulder he turned her face to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
him, but as he was about to draw her close he noticed
a sadness in her eyes that puzzled him.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?” he asked gently.</p>

<p>“Tell me what’s right!” she replied, as she bit the
tip of her handkerchief. “I’m sure I’ll kill you when I
confess—and yet, I must tell you, so you can know what
I’m like.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Last night I promised to marry Ted Courtney.”</p>

<p>Mauney stared incredulously.</p>

<p>“Courtney!” he stammered. “But—Freda—why?”</p>

<p>Her eyes, as they turned toward the window, were
dry and possessed of a bitter calmness.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand,” Mauney said, and paused.
“You promised to marry Courtney. Do you mean that?”</p>

<p>“Yes—unfortunately.”</p>

<p>“But surely—” he began. “You’re not going to—to
do it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mauney,” she said, “I’m going to be his wife.
Will you let me explain?”</p>

<p>He stared at her mystified.</p>

<p>“Remember me for one virtue, will you?” she asked,
as she turned to fondle his coat lapels.</p>

<p>“Remember that I never deceived you. How can I tell
you? Last night,” she continued in a lower tone, as
her eyes shifted to the pine branches beyond the window,
“I couldn’t have been quite myself. I tried to fight
against my feelings, but I was crazy with regret, and
weak.”</p>

<p>“But, Freda.”</p>

<p>“Sometime,” she interrupted. “You may be able to
understand. I’m afraid you couldn’t now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span></p>

<p>“But think,” he said. “You can break your promise.
You <em>must</em>!” He drew her impetuously to him.</p>

<p>“Don’t, please don’t,” she implored. “I can’t let you.”</p>

<p>His arms were trembling and on his face she read
dismay. “But have you never loved me?” he demanded,
“all these months?”</p>

<p>“I am an impatient person, Mauney,” she replied,
freeing herself from his arms. “With me love must be
romance or nothing. I must be taken when the fire
burns in my heart. I can’t control it. All I know is
that somehow you missed it. And now I cannot—come
to you.”</p>

<p>Mauney, plunging his hands into his pockets, wheeled
suddenly towards the window and stood for a long
moment in puzzled meditation.</p>

<p>“Do you love Courtney?” he asked suddenly, glancing
towards her.</p>

<p>“That question,” she replied, “seems somehow to be
outside the rights of our present conversation.”</p>

<p>Her face, which had been pale, flushed a little. “If
you are going to demand too many explanations, then
I’ll ask you how it was possible for you to put Max
Lee between us?”</p>

<p>“Why, Freda,” he began.</p>

<p>“And don’t you think,” she interrupted, “that, if you
are quite frank with yourself, you’ll admit that you
played with me a little longer than I could be expected
to stand?”</p>

<p>He did not reply.</p>

<p>“Mauney,” she said, seating herself with all appearance
of complacency in a deep chair. “Let’s not insist
on rebelling against what is inevitable.”</p>

<p>“But why should it be inevitable?” he asked. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
think I am sufficiently intelligent to grasp any reasonable
explanation.”</p>

<p>He walked quickly towards her. “Look here,” he
said, folding his arms on his chest and fastening her
gaze, “if you don’t love Courtney, why the devil will
you marry him?”</p>

<p>For a moment her dark eyes seemed to expand with
her effort to capture a fit reply. Then she said, slowly
and softly, as if, in any event, her realistic nature could
find some solace in things as they are: “I am going to
marry him because he loves me, and because I was weak
enough to give myself to him.”</p>

<span class="smcap">Gypsies’ Fire.</span></h3>

<p>Like a flash the situation dawned on Mauney. It
dawned so flashingly that he tried to hide from it
all afternoon. Her impetuous nature! His own tardiness
and his own misinterpreted duty to Maxwell Lee.
While he had maintained loyalty to Lee, this woman,
this Freda, whose very likeness had been burned into
his soul, had been slipping from his fingers. And now,
torn between self-blame and an effort to excuse her most
recent fault, he began to recognize just how ultimate
and hopeless the whole matter was.</p>

<p>He met Mr. Fitch, of Lantern Marsh, on the street
and accepted a ride to the farm with him. Perhaps
he would never have thought of going home had Fitch
not suggested it. There was nothing at Lantern Marsh
to go for, either. But he craved solitude, and at least
his old home would afford him that. The old swamp
would somehow understand him, he felt. There would
be a queer kind of sympathy in that old swamp.</p>

<p>When he reached home he found a visitor, one he
had almost forgotten and one whom he was not overjoyed
at meeting in his present chaotic mood. David
McBratney had been in Merlton for eight years and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
only now, after so long an absence, refreshing his acquaintance
with the people of his youth. It was fortunate,
according to Dave, that Mauney had just happened
in when he was there. But Mauney felt that the
most unfortunate fact in the world was that he should
have to converse politely with any one to-night. They
were all just ready to sit down at the supper table—William
with his shirt sleeves rolled up on his sun-burned
arms, Evelyn placing her two red-faced little
boys on stools, and McBratney being shown a place beside
Mauney on the opposite side. When they were
seated, William, carving knife in one hand and a long,
serving fork in the other, looked up lazily from the
crisply-browned roast on the platter toward his wife and
made an awkward, snuffling sound. Mrs. Bard caught
the hint.</p>

<p>“Mr. McBratney,” she announced, “will ask the blessing.
Bow your heads, you kids!”</p>

<p>“Bless, O Lord, we beseech Thee, this food, forgive
our sins, and guide us ever in the light of thy countenance.
This we ask in the name of Jesus Christ our
Lord. Amen.”</p>

<p>An amused smile flickered over William’s face as he
winked unnoticed to Evelyn, his wife. Then, plunging
his fork into the juicy meat, he proceeded to slice
it.</p>

<p>“Dave,” he asked. “How’s your appetite?”</p>

<p>“Pretty good, Bill,” responded McBratney. “It’s a
long time since I had a meal off o’ this old table, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>Evelyn Bard, opposite her husband, was busy spreading
butter on thick slices of bread for her boys. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
stared in silence at the visitor, interrupting their occupation
only long enough to accept the buttered bread
and to begin chewing it.</p>

<p>McBratney had lost nothing of his swarthy complexion.
His dark eyes were just as sharp, but more
serious, than formerly. He wore a threadbare, yet neat,
grey suit and a plain, blue four-in-hand necktie. Broad
of shoulder, he lounged against the edge of the table,
gazing half-meditatively at the children.</p>

<p>“Well, Dave,” remarked William, as they all fell to
eating, “you hain’t never been back since you went away
have you?”</p>

<p>“This is the first time, Bill. I got kind of lonesome
to see the old folks; so I thought I’d come down for
a few days. My mother tells me that dad has never
been satisfied since he sold the farm. She says he drives
down here about once a week, just to see how things
are going.”</p>

<p>“Yep,” nodded William, “at <em>least</em> once a week, don’t
he, Evelyn?”</p>

<p>She nodded. “The poor old chap can’t stay away,”
she explained. “He never should have sold out, I always
think. When a man gets attached to a place it’s
foolish to leave, at his age, anyway.”</p>

<p>William was chewing his food thoughtfully, with an
expression of narrow-eyed meditation.</p>

<p>“Dave,” he ventured, at length. “I always thought
your old man never forgave you for leavin’ home.
Course, I never said a word to him, understand. It
takes all kinds of people to make up the world, and I’m
not sayin’ you didn’t do the right thing, neither. Maybe
some people might say you was wrong, but I got enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
to do without tendin’ to other people’s business.” William’s
eye quickly took in McBratney’s business suit,
while a look of curiosity came over his face. “Of
course,” he said, in a tone that challenged explanation,
“I always had an idea as you had gone into preachin’.”</p>

<p>“I studied at it awhile,” McBratney admitted, good-naturedly,
“and then I suddenly quit it.”</p>

<p>“What made you quit it, Dave?” persisted William.
“Was it costin’ too much?”</p>

<p>“No, it don’t cost too much, but I couldn’t see much
head nor tail to it,” confessed McBratney. “I went on
with it till they started talking about the Trinity, and—”</p>

<p>“Trinity, eh, Dave?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and a lot of other theories that don’t count.
When they began splitting hairs about baptism and
sacraments, I said to myself, ‘This isn’t pitching hay!’”</p>

<p>“That’s a fact, too, Dave,” nodded William, sagely.</p>

<p>“’Twasn’t what <em>I</em> was cut out for anyway,” said
McBratney. “I couldn’t see how baptism nor sacraments,
nor any such like, was going to save the world.
I saw people every day in Merlton, who were so deep
in sin that they were pretty near hopeless, and, although
I don’t know much, I reckoned that these fine points
of doctrine were all twaddle.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I always thought, Dave. You didn’t
make no mistake there, I tell yuh.”</p>

<p>“No, Bill,” he replied. “All I knew was that something
big and strong had taken hold of me. I knew
that I had the love of God in my heart and that every
ounce of muscle in my body was going to be used up
helping some of these poor beggars on to their feet.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Dave—that’s the only religion there is,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
commented William. “You didn’t make no mistake
there.”</p>

<p>“And so I just pitched those Hebrew books about
as far as I could heave, and settled down into steady
work at the settlement.”</p>

<p>“Good for you, Dave. What kind of settlement do
you mean?”</p>

<p>“A settlement, Bill, is a kind of organization supported
by various people for reclaiming bums and no-goods,”
said McBratney. “We take in the riff-raff,
without a word, give ’em clothes and grub, and get ’em
work to do. We start them off in life again and give
them a second chance to go straight. Our idea is to
reclaim damaged goods, Bill, we try to—”</p>

<p>“Um-hum!” interjected William, “I can see the sense
in that, Dave. What’s your work?”</p>

<p>“I’m on the employment department. I keep a list
of jobs, and fit these bums into them. After they get
started I go around and see how they’re doing. If
they’re falling down on the job I brace them up a little
or change their job for them.”</p>

<p>“Do you get much salary, Dave?”</p>

<p>“No. It isn’t the money I’m after, Bill. What I
like about it is the game. Some of these bums have to
be handled pretty carefully, and that’s my work. I
never was afraid of anybody, and I’ve got to meet the
man yet that can handle me.”</p>

<p>McBratney’s eyes sparkled with keen pleasure, and
he squared his shoulders unconsciously as he spoke.
Fighting the worst in men was his occupation. It was
an energetic business of consecrated brawn. It was muscular
Christianity of the most earnest and pugnacious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
type. Mauney felt that here beside him at the table
sat a kind of modern crusader. One <em>had</em> to be good
if McBratney was about, or otherwise be able to defeat
him in a pugilistic contest.</p>

<p>For two or three hours Mauney found no alternative,
but to sit and talk with him. At any other time the occupation
would have been bearable or even pleasant,
for he discovered many admirable, and almost lovable,
qualities—if one could dare to feel so tenderly toward
a modern Sir Galahad. But Mauney was too full of his
own troubles to-night to be otherwise than indifferent to
McBratney. His heart seemed to be breaking beneath
these troubles. He wanted to leave his brother and
the others, and walk alone by himself by that old swamp
in front of the house. McBratney had changed, William
and Evelyn had changed, he himself was changing
in some indefinite way, while all the universe seemed in
flux. What existed without change?</p>

<p>Some one came walking up the lane and opened the
kitchen door. It was the Englishman who rented the
old McBratney farm. His face was mildly excited.</p>

<p>“Did you see the fire?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Where, Joe?” asked William, uneasily.</p>

<p>He stepped back on the verandah and looked towards
the road, and Mauney saw a dull, red reflection on his
face. In a moment they were all walking toward the
road. By some means a fire had started among the
dried grasses of the swamp, and was spreading rapidly,
with nervous little flashes of flame shooting up through
heavy, grey clouds of smoke. There was no wind to
fan the fire, but the light grass carried it swiftly along
in a curve like an enlarging wave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s going to get into them cedars, too,” said William.</p>

<p>“Well, let ’em go,” said McBratney. “The barn’s
safe as long as there’s no wind. There’s nothing you
can do, anyway.”</p>

<p>“I wonder how it got started?” queried William. “I
seen some gypsies in that end o’ the field over there
last night. Maybe they left some live coals.”</p>

<p>“That may be,” admitted Joe, the Englishman. “But
I’ve heard as how a bog like this here sometimes generates
its own fire by spontaneous combustion, I have.”</p>

<p>Their faces were all well lit up now by the reflection.
Mauney glanced at the house. Its red bricks were illuminated
by a ghastly, unnatural glow, while the window-panes
began flashing spasmodically, one after the
other, as if some one inside the house were going with
a light from room to room. The fire ran swiftly toward
the edge of the swamp, and the cedar boughs burst
quickly into flame as if they were composed of explosive
substance. Among a dozen trees the flame
spread savagely until the appearance was that of huge,
black torches, perched together to give a warning to
the sky.</p>

<p>Held by the fascination which fire always possesses,
they stood for two hours watching its ravages. From
shore to shore the crimson, liquid wave crossed and rebounded
until at last the cedars and hemlocks were all
ablaze, forming a wide and brilliant fringe for a central,
smoke-obscured space. It was not like the same place.
It was not like the Lantern Marsh. Later, when the
yellow flames had all gone out and the rising moon
showed only the constant clouds of smudgy smoke rising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
and disappearing, Mauney sat alone on the front
steps of the farmhouse, watching it with mute fascination.
At last his marsh was completely defeated, ruined
and blotted out. But a whimsical comfort possessed
him. It was not defeated. Winter and then spring—and
the unfailing reservoirs of the deep earth would
pour water into the scorched basin again. Grass and
trees would eventually grow up where now there was
only ashes, to proclaim that life had gained the victory
over death—that there was no death, but only life.</p>
